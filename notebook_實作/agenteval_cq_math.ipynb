    "\n",
    "- `CriticAgent`: This is an LLM-based agent that generates a list criteria $(c_1, \\dots, c_n)$ to help to evaluate a utility given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `QuantifierAgent`: This agent quantifies the performance of any sample task based on the criteria designed by the `CriticAgent` in the following way: $(c_1=a_1, \\dots, c_n=a_n)$\n",

Therefore, the triangle DPF is a right triangle. \\n\\nSince we know the angles \\u03b1, \\u03b2, and the length DG, we can determine the length DF using the law of cosines:\\n\\nLet's calculate the length of DG first:\\n\\nDG = DH + HG = (13.6569 - 4) + (9.6569 - 4) = 9.6569 + 5.6569 = 15.3138\\n\\nNow, let \\u03b1 be the angle between line DH and DF, and \\u03b2 be the angle between line HG and DF. We can use the law of cosines to calculate the length of DF:\\n\\nDF^2 = DH^2 + HG^2 - 2 * DH * HG * cos(\\u03b1 + \\u03b2)\\n\\nWe also know angle DAB = \\u03b1, angle GHB = \\u03b2 and AB = FG = 4.\\n\\nWe can calculate cos(\\u03b1 + \\u03b2) using the cosine formula for the addition of angles:\\n\\ncos(\\u03b1 + \\u03b2) = cos(\\u03b1) * cos(\\u03b2) - sin(\\u03b1) * sin(\\u03b2)\\n\\nTo find sin(\\u03b1) and cos(\\u03b1), we can use right triangle with sides DA, AB, and DB. Since DB = BA = 4, we have:\\n\\ncos(\\u03b1) = AD / DB = 4 / 4 = 1\\nsin(\\u03b1) = BA / DB = 4 / 4 = 1\\n\\nSimilarly, for angle \\u03b2, we have right triangle with sides GH, HB, and GB.
