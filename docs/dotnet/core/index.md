# AutoGen Core

AutoGen Core for .NET follows the same concepts and conventions of its Python counterpart. In fact, in order to understand the concepts in the .NET version, we recommend reading the Python documentation first. Unless otherwise stated, the concepts in the Python version map to .NET.

Any important differences between the language versions are documented in the [Differences from Python](./differences-from-python.md) section. For things that only affect a given language, such as dependency injection or host builder patterns, these will not be specified in the differences document.

For .NET we are starting with the core functionality and will be expanding support progressively. So far the core abstractions of Agent and Runtime are available. The InProcessRuntime is the only runtime available at this time. We will be expanding to cross language support in upcoming releases.
