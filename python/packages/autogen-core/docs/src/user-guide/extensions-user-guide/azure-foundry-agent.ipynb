Here, important aspects of the agent including the provisioned model, tools (e.g, code interpreter, bing search grounding, file search etc.), observability, and security are managed by Azure. This allows you to focus on building your agent without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\n",

You need to create a Grounding with Bing Search resource, and then connect this resource to your Azure AI Agents. When a user sends a query, Azure AI Agents decide if Grounding with Bing Search should be leveraged or not. If so, it will leverage Bing to search over public web data and return relevant chunks. Lastly, Azure AI Agents will use returned chunks to generate a response.\n",
