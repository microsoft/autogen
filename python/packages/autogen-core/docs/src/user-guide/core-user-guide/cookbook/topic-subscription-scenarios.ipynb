    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we explore how broadcasting works for agent communication in AutoGen using four different broadcasting scenarios. These scenarios illustrate various ways to handle and distribute messages among agents. We'll use a consistent example of a tax management company processing client requests to demonstrate each scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a tax management company that offers various services to clients, such as tax planning, dispute resolution, compliance, and preparation. The company employs a team of tax specialists, each with expertise in one of these areas, and a tax system manager who oversees the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients submit requests that need to be processed by the appropriate specialists. The communication between the clients, the tax system manager, and the tax specialists is handled through broadcasting in this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore how different broadcasting scenarios affect the way messages are distributed among agents and how they can be used to tailor the communication flow to specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcasting Scenarios Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following broadcasting scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-Tenant, Single Scope of Publishing**\n",
    "2. **Multi-Tenant, Single Scope of Publishing**\n",
    "3. **Single-Tenant, Multiple Scopes of Publishing**\n",
    "4. **Multi-Tenant, Multiple Scopes of Publishing**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scenario represents a different approach to message distribution and agent interaction within the system. By understanding these scenarios, you can design agent communication strategies that best fit your application's requirements."

    "### 1. Single-Tenant, Single Scope of Publishing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenarios Explanation\n",
    "In the single-tenant, single scope of publishing scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All agents operate within a single tenant (e.g., one client or user session).\n",
    "- Messages are published to a single topic, and all agents subscribe to this topic.\n",
    "- Every agent receives every message that gets published to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is suitable for situations where all agents need to be aware of all messages, and there's no need to isolate communication between different groups of agents or sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application in the Tax Specialist Company\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tax specialist company, this scenario implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All tax specialists receive every client request and internal message.\n",
    "- All agents collaborate closely, with full visibility of all communications.\n",
    "- Useful for tasks or teams where all agents need to be aware of all messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Scenario Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subscriptions: All agents use the default subscription(e.g., \"default\").\n",
    "- Publishing: Messages are published to the default topic.\n",
    "- Message Handling: Each agent decides whether to act on a message based on its content and available handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "- Simplicity: Easy to set up and understand.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Promotes transparency and collaboration among agents.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Agents can dynamically decide which messages to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations\n",
    "- Scalability: May not scale well with a large number of agents or messages.\n",
    "- Efficiency: Agents may receive many irrelevant messages, leading to unnecessary processing."
