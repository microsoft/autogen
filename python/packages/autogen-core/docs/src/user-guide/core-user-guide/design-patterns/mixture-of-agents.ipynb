    "# Mixture of Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mixture of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692) is a multi-agent design pattern\n",
    "that models after the feed-forward neural network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern consists of two types of agents: worker agents and a single orchestrator agent.\n",
    "Worker agents are organized into multiple layers, with each layer consisting of a fixed number of worker agents.\n",
    "Messages from the worker agents in a previous layer are concatenated and sent to\n",
    "all the worker agents in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example implements the Mixture of Agents pattern using the core library\n",
    "following the [original implementation](https://github.com/togethercomputer/moa) of multi-layer mixture of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a high-level procedure overview of the pattern:\n",
    "1. The orchestrator agent takes input a user task and first dispatches it to the worker agents in the first layer.\n",
    "2. The worker agents in the first layer process the task and return the results to the orchestrator agent.\n",
    "3. The orchestrator agent then synthesizes the results from the first layer and dispatches an updated task with the previous results to the worker agents in the second layer.\n",
    "4. The process continues until the final layer is reached.\n",
    "5. In the final layer, the orchestrator agent aggregates the results from previous layer and returns a single final result to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the direct messaging API {py:meth}`~autogen_core.BaseAgent.send_message` to implement this pattern.\n",
    "This makes it easier to add more features like worker task cancellation and error handling in the future."
