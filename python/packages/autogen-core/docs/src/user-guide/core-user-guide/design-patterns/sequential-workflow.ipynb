    "Sequential Workflow is a multi-agent design pattern where agents respond in a deterministic sequence. Each agent in the workflow performs a specific task by processing a message, generating a response, and then passing it to the next agent. This pattern is useful for creating deterministic workflows where each agent contributes to a pre-specified sub-task."

    "The pipeline consists of four specialized agents:\n",
    "- **Concept Extractor Agent**: Analyzes the initial product description to extract key features, target audience, and unique selling points (USPs). The output is a structured analysis in a single text block.\n",
    "- **Writer Agent**: Crafts compelling marketing copy based on the extracted concepts. This agent transforms the analytical insights into engaging promotional content, delivering a cohesive narrative in a single text block.\n",
    "- **Format & Proof Agent**: Polishes the draft copy by refining grammar, enhancing clarity, and maintaining consistent tone. This agent ensures professional quality and delivers a well-formatted final version.\n",
