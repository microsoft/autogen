    "In AgentChat, agents can be rapidly implemented using preset agent configurations. To illustrate this, we will begin with creating an agent that can address tasks by responding to messages it receives. "

    "The code snippet above introduces two high level concepts in AgentChat: `Agent` and `Team`.  An Agent helps us define what actions are taken when a message is received. Specifically, we use the `AssistantAgent` preset - an agent that can be given tools (functions) that it can then use to address tasks.  A Team helps us define the rules for how agents interact with each other.  In the  `RoundRobinGroupChat` team, agents receive messages in a sequential round-robin fashion.  "
