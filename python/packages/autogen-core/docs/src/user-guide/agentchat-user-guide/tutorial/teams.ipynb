    "In AgentChat, teams define how groups of agents collaborate to address tasks.\n",
    "A team is composed of one or more agents, and interacts with your application\n",

    "- {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat`: All participants share context and takes turn to respond in a round-robin fashion.\n",
    "- {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat`: All participants share context and use a model-based selector (with custom override) to select the next agent to respond.\n",
    "- {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm`: All participants share context and use {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage`to pass control to the next agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, a team API consists of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskRunner.run`: To process a task, which can be a {py:class}`str`, {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.TextMessage`, or {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.MultiModalMessage`, and returns {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskResult`. The task can also be `None` to resume processing the previous task if the team has not been reset.\n",
    "- {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskRunner.run_stream`: Same as {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskRunner.run`, but returns a async generator of messages and the final task result.\n",
    "- {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.Team.reset`: To reset the team state if the next task is not related to the previous task. Otherwise, the team can utilize the context from the previous task to process the next one.\n",
