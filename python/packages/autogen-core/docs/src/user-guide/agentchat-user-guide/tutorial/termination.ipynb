    "In the previous section, we explored how to define agents, and organize them into teams that can solve tasks by communicating (a conversation). However, conversations can go on forever, and in many cases, we need to know _when_ to stop them. This is the role of the termination condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentChat supports several termination condition by providing a base {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TerminationCondition` class and several implementations that inherit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of ChatMessage objects  since the last time the condition was called, and returns a StopMessage if the conversation should be terminated, or None otherwise. Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset before it can be used again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things to note about termination conditions: \n",
    "- They are stateful, and must be reset before they can be used again. \n",
    "- They can be combined using the AND and OR operators. \n",
    "- They are implemented/enforced by the team, and not by the agents. An agent may signal or request termination e.g., by  sending a StopMessage, but the team is responsible for enforcing it.\n"
