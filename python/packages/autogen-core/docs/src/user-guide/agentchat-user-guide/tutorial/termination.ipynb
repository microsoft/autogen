    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we explored how to define agents, and organize them into teams that can solve tasks. However, a run can go on forever, and in many cases, we need to know _when_ to stop them. This is the role of the termination condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentChat supports several termination condition by providing a base {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TerminationCondition` class and several implementations that inherit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.AgentEvent` or {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.ChatMessage` objects **since the last time the condition was called**, and returns a {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.StopMessage` if the conversation should be terminated, or `None` otherwise.\n",
    "Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset by calling {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TerminationCondition.reset` before it can be used again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things to note about termination conditions: \n",
    "- They are stateful but reset automatically after each run ({py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskRunner.run` or {py:meth}`~autogen_agentchat.base.TaskRunner.run_stream`) is finished.\n",
    "- They can be combined using the AND and OR operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "For group chat teams (i.e., {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat`,\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat`, and {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm`),\n",
    "the termination condition is called after each agent responds.\n",
    "While a response may contain multiple inner messages, the team calls its termination condition just once for all the messages from a single response.\n",
    "So the condition is called with the \"delta sequence\" of messages since the last time it was called.\n",

    "3. {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.conditions.TokenUsageTermination`: Stops when a certain number of prompt or completion tokens are used. This requires the agents to report token usage in their messages.\n",
    "4. {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.conditions.TimeoutTermination`: Stops after a specified duration in seconds.\n",
    "5. {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.conditions.HandoffTermination`: Stops when a handoff to a specific target is requested. Handoff messages can be used to build patterns such as {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm`. This is useful when you want to pause the run and allow application or user to provide input when an agent hands off to them.\n",
    "6. {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.conditions.SourceMatchTermination`: Stops after a specific agent responds.\n",
    "7. {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.conditions.ExternalTermination`: Enables programmatic control of termination from outside the run. This is useful for UI integration (e.g., \"Stop\" buttons in chat interfaces).\n",
