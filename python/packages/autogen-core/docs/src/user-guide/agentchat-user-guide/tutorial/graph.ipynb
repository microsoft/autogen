These gases trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.\\n\\n3. **Temperature Rise**: The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century, largely due to increased CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels.\\n\\n4. **Climate Impact**: Climate change causes extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves. These impacts threaten ecosystems, wildlife, and human populations.\\n\\n5. **Ocean Changes**: Oceans absorb much of the excess heat and CO2, leading to ocean warming, acidification, and rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities and marine life.\\n\\n6. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change contributes to habitat loss and threatens many species with extinction, disrupting ecosystems and food chains.\\n\\n7. **Food Security**: Changes in climate patterns can affect agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and increased prices, exacerbating global hunger and malnutrition.\\n\\n8. **Socioeconomic Effects**: Vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries, are most at risk, facing displacement, health issues, and economic instability due to climate impacts.\\n\\n9. **Mitigation and Adaptation**: Efforts to combat climate change focus on reducing GHG emissions (mitigation) through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and changes in land use, along with adaptation strategies to cope with unavoidable impacts.\\n\\n10. **Global Agreements**: The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\n11. **Public Awareness and Action**: Climate change awareness is growing, leading to increased advocacy for sustainable practices and policies aimed at reducing emissions and protecting the environment.\\n\\n12. **Scientific Consensus**: There is overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real, primarily driven by human activities, and poses a significant threat to the planet.\", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='analyst', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=500, completion_tokens=468), metadata={}, content='The summary provides a thorough overview of climate change, covering its definition, causes, impacts, and responses.

    "\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraph` introduces several important building blocks that work together to create directed agent workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraphBuilder`\n",
    "The {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraphBuilder` is a **fluent builder** for constructing execution graphs programmatically.\n",
    "It provides methods to:\n",
    "- Add agents (nodes) to the graph.\n",
    "- Add edges between agents, optionally with conditions.\n",
    "- Define complex topologies including parallel, conditional, and looping flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "builder = AGGraphBuilder()\n",
    "builder.add_node(agent_a).add_node(agent_b)\n",
    "builder.add_edge(agent_a, agent_b)\n",
    "graph = builder.build()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraphBuilder` automatically validates that the graph structure is sound before allowing execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DiGraphNode\n",
    "Represents an agent node in the directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields:\n",
    "- `name`: The unique name of the agent.\n",
    "- `edges`: A list of outgoing edges (to other nodes).\n",
    "- `activation`: Either \"all\" (wait for all parents to finish) or \"any\" (activate when any parent finishes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DiGraphNode(name=\"writer\", edges=[DiGraphEdge(target=\"reviewer\")], activation=\"all\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DiGraphEdge\n",
    "Represents a directed connection from one node to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields:\n",
    "- `target`: The name of the target node.\n",
    "- `condition`: (Optional) If set, the transition only happens if the message content matches the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DiGraphEdge(target=\"reviewer\", condition=\"approve\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DiGraph\n",
    "A validated collection of DiGraphNode objects forming the execution graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Computes **start nodes** (nodes with no incoming edges).\n",
    "- Computes **leaf nodes** (nodes with no outgoing edges).\n",
    "- Validates that any cycles in the graph have safe exits (i.e., conditional branches).\n",
    "\n",
    "A DiGraph ensures the workflow has at least one entry point and at least one termination point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraph`\n",
    "The main runner class that:\n",
    "- Executes agents according to the DiGraph structure.\n",
    "- Manages agent selection at each turn.\n",
    "- Supports saving and restoring execution state (e.g., for retries, continuation).\n",
    "- Supports flexible termination conditions (e.g., max turns, text triggers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "workflow = AGGraph(participants=builder.get_participants(), graph=builder.build())\n",
    "await workflow.run(task=\"Draft and review a document.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraph` separates **execution control** (who speaks when) from **message filtering** (what each agent can see).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Filtering\n",
    "Even though {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.AGGraph` controls agent execution order, agents may still have access to previous conversation history. \n",
    "\n",
    "To **control what messages an agent sees**, you can:\n",
    "- Wrap the agent using {py:class}`~autogen_graph.MessageFilterAgent`.\n",
    "- Specify fine-grained rules using {py:class}`~autogen_graph.MessageFilterConfig` and {py:class}`~autogen_graph.PerSourceFilter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows focusing an agent’s attention only on:\n",
    "- Specific messages from certain sources.\n",
    "- Only the most recent (or oldest) messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filtered_agent = MessageFilterAgent(\n",
    "    name=\"critic\",\n",
    "    wrapped_agent=critic,\n",
    "    filter=MessageFilterConfig(per_source=[\n",
    "        PerSourceFilter(source=\"writer\", position=\"last\", count=1)\n",
    "    ])\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Modes\n",
    "Each node can have an activation mode:\n",
    "- **all** (default): The agent activates after **all** its parent nodes have finished.\n",
    "- **any**: The agent activates after **any one** parent node finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows modeling different coordination behaviors:\n",
    "- Synchronization points (all parents must complete).\n",
    "- Early branching (first parent to finish triggers execution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Branching\n",
    "Edges can be **conditional**: only followed if a specific text condition is matched in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "builder.add_conditional_edges(agent_a, {\"yes\": agent_b, \"no\": agent_c})\n",
    "```\n",
    "This enables modeling decision trees, approvals, rejections, and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops with Safe Exit\n",
