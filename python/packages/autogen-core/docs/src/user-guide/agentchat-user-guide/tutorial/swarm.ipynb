    "# Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm` implements a team in which agents can hand off \n",
    "task to other agents based on their capabilities. \n",
    "It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in \n",
    "[an experimental project](https://github.com/openai/swarm).\n",
    "The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while\n",
    "all agents share the same message context.\n",
    "This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than\n",
    "relying on a central orchestrator such as in {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm` is a high-level API. If you need more\n",
    "control and customization that is not supported by this API, you can take a look\n",
    "at the [Handoff Pattern](../../core-user-guide/design-patterns/handoffs.ipynb)\n",
    "in the Core API documentation and implement your own version of the Swarm pattern.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm` team is a group chat\n",
    "where agents take turn to generate a response. \n",
    "Similar to the {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat`\n",
    "and {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat`: participant agents\n",
    "all share the same mesasge context.\n",
    "\n",
    "But different from the other two group chat teams, at each turn,\n",
    "**the speaker agent is selected based on the most recent\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage` message in the context.**\n",
    "This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage` to signal\n",
    "which other agents that it hands off to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent`, you can set the\n",
    "`handoffs` argument to specify which agents it can hand off to. You can\n",
    "use {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.agents.Handoff` to customize the message\n",
    "content and handoff behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each agent has the ability to generate {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage`\n",
    "   to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent`, this means setting the `handoffs` argument.\n",
    "2. When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make locallized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "3. When an agent generates a {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage`, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n",
    "4. The process continues until a termination condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you two examples of how to use the {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm` team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A customer support team with human-in-the-loop handoff.\n",
    "2. An automonous team for content generation."
