However, the traditional development of these systems often requires substantial technical expertise, making it inaccessible for non-developers. The introduction of no-code platforms aims to shift this paradigm, allowing users without formal programming knowledge to design, debug, and deploy multi-agent systems. This review synthesizes current literature concerning no-code tools developed for building multi-agent AI systems, highlighting recent advancements and emerging trends.\\n\\n### No-Code Development Tools\\n\\n#### AutoGen Studio\\n\\nOne of the prominent no-code tools is **AutoGen Studio**, developed by Dibia et al. (2024). This tool provides a web interface and a declarative specification method utilizing JSON, enabling rapid prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows. The drag-and-drop capabilities streamline the design process, making complex interactions between agents more manageable. The framework operates on four primary design principles that cater specifically to no-code development, contributing to an accessible pathway for users to harness multi-agent frameworks for various applications (Dibia et al., 2024).\\n\\n#### AI2Apps Visual IDE\\n\\nAnother notable tool is **AI2Apps**, described by Pang et al. (2024). It serves as a Visual Integrated Development Environment that incorporates a comprehensive set of tools from prototyping to deployment. The platform's user-friendly interface allows for the visualization of code through drag-and-drop components, facilitating smoother integration of different agents. An extension system enhances the platform's capabilities, showcasing the potential for customization and scalability in agent application development. The reported efficiency improvements in token consumption and API calls indicate substantial benefits in user-centric design (Pang et al., 2024).\\n\\n### Performance Enhancements in Multi-Agent Configurations\\n\\nHymel et al. (2024) examined the collaborative performance of commercially available AI tools, demonstrating a measurable improvement when integrating multiple agents in a shared configuration. Their experiments showcased how cooperation between tools like Crowdbotics PRD AI and GitHub Copilot significantly improved task success rates, illustrating the practical benefits of employing no-code tools in multi-agent environments. This synergy reflects the critical need for frameworks that inherently support such integrations, especially through no-code mechanisms, to enhance user experience and productivity (Hymel et al., 2024).\\n\\n### Trust and Usability in AI Agents\\n\\nThe concept of trust in AI, particularly in LLM-based automation agents, has gained attention. Schwartz et al. (2023) addressed the challenges and considerations unique to this new generation of agents, highlighting how no-code platforms ease access and usability for non-technical users. The paper emphasizes the need for further research into the trust factors integral to effective multi-agent systems, advocating for a user-centric approach in the design and evaluation of these no-code tools (Schwartz et al., 2023).\\n\\n### Full-Pipeline AutoML with Multi-Agent Systems\\n\\nThe **AutoML-Agent** framework proposed by Trirat et al. (2024) brings another layer of innovation to the no-code landscape. This framework enhances existing automated machine learning processes by using multiple specialized agents that collaboratively manage the full AI development pipeline from data retrieval to model deployment. The novelty lies in its retrieval-augmented planning strategy, which allows for efficient task decomposition and parallel execution, optimizing the overall development experience for non-experts (Trirat et al., 2024).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe literature presents a growing array of no-code tools designed to democratize the development of multi-agent systems. Innovations such as AutoGen Studio, AI2Apps, and collaborative frameworks like AutoML-Agent highlight a trend towards user-centric, efficient design that encourages participation beyond technical boundaries. Future research should continue to explore aspects of trust, usability, and integration to further refine these tools and expand their applicability across various domains.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Dibia, V., Chen, J., Bansal, G., Syed, S., Fourney, A., Zhu, E., Wang, C., & Amershi, S.
