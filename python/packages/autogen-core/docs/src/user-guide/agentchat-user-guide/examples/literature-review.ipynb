      "### Literature Review on No-Code Tools for Building Multi-Agent AI Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "The advent of no-code and low-code platforms has revolutionized the development of software applications, including multi-agent AI systems. These tools enable users, regardless of their technical background, to create sophisticated systems through visual interfaces and pre-built components. This literature review explores the current landscape of no-code tools specifically designed for building multi-agent AI systems, examining their capabilities, features, and potential use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **AutoGen Studio**\n",
      "One of the prominent tools in this domain is **AutoGen Studio**, which provides a no-code environment for designing and debugging multi-agent systems. According to a recent paper published in **arXiv**, this tool focuses on facilitating collaboration among different agents, including generative AI models and associated tools. It emphasizes usability, allowing developers to build complex systems without extensive programming knowledge (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Multi Agents System (MAS) Builder**\n",
      "Another notable platform is the **Multi Agents System (MAS) Builder** by **Relevance AI**. This tool allows users to construct AI worker systems that can operate collaboratively without requiring any coding skills. The platform highlights features such as the ability to create and deploy AI teams optimized for tasks like sales and customer support, showcasing the practical applications of no-code tools in business environments (Relevance AI, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Crew AI**\n",
      "**Crew AI** offers a comprehensive framework for automating workflows through multi-agent systems. It includes a UI Studio that facilitates the creation of automations without programming. Users can leverage pre-configured templates and build agents that execute tasks across various domains. This flexibility makes it suitable for industries seeking to enhance operational efficiency through automated systems (Crew AI, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Insights and Community Experiences**\n",
      "Additionally, community discussions and insights shared on platforms like **Reddit** provide anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness and user experiences when employing no-code tools for multi-agent systems. Users share their journeys in building complex systems, highlighting both successes and challenges faced during development (April 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The evolution of no-code tools has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for developing multi-agent AI systems. Platforms such as AutoGen Studio, MAS Builder, and Crew AI exemplify the potential for creating sophisticated systems without traditional coding requirements. As these tools continue to grow in capability and user adoption, they promise to democratize AI development and enable a wider range of professionals to leverage AI technologies in their work.\n",

Researchers have paid much attention\\\\non its partially observable and cooperative settings for meeting real-world\\\\nrequirements. For testing performance of different algorithms, standardized\\\\nenvironments are designed such as the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which is\\\\none of the most successful MARL benchmarks. To our best knowledge, most of\\\\ncurrent environments are synchronous, where agents execute actions in the same\\\\npace. However, heterogeneous agents usually have their own action spaces and\\\\nthere is no guarantee for actions from different agents to have the same\\\\nexecuted cycle, which leads to asynchronous multi-agent cooperation. Inspired\\\\nfrom the Wargame, a confrontation game between two armies abstracted from real\\\\nworld environment, we propose the first Partially Observable Asynchronous\\\\nmulti-agent Cooperation challenge (POAC) for the MARL community. Specifically,\\\\nPOAC supports two teams of heterogeneous agents to fight with each other, where\\\\nan agent selects actions based on its own observations and cooperates\\\\nasynchronously with its allies. Moreover, POAC is a light weight, flexible and\\\\neasy to use environment, which can be configured by users to meet different\\\\nexperimental requirements such as self-play model, human-AI model and so on.\\\\nAlong with our benchmark, we offer six game scenarios of varying difficulties\\\\nwith the built-in rule-based AI as opponents. Finally, since most MARL\\\\nalgorithms are designed for synchronous agents, we revise several\\\\nrepresentatives to meet the asynchronous setting, and the relatively poor\\\\nexperimental results validate the challenge of POAC. Source code is released in\\\\n\\\\\\\\url{http://turingai.ia.ac.cn/data\\\\\\\\_center/show}.\\', \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03809v1\\'}]', call_id='call_HnNhdJzH3xCbiofbbcoqzFDP')]\n",
