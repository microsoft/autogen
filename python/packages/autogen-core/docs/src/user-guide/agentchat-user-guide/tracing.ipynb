    "# Tracing and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen has [built-in support for tracing](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/core-user-guide/framework/telemetry.html) and observability for collecting comprehensive records on the execution of your application. This feature is useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding the flow of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability is powered by the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) library, which means you can use any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend to collect and analyze traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen follows the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) for tracing, for agents and tools.\n",
    "It also follows the [Semantic Conventions for GenAI Systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) currently under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, you need to install the OpenTelemetry Python package. You can do this using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the SDK installed, the simplest way to set up tracing in AutoGen is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure an OpenTelemetry tracer provider\n",
    "2. Set up an exporter to send traces to your backend\n",
    "3. Connect the tracer provider to the AutoGen runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Telemetry Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect and view traces, you need to set up a telemetry backend. Several open-source options are available, including Jaeger, Zipkin. For this example, we will use Jaeger as our telemetry backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick start, you can run Jaeger locally using Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d --name jaeger \\\n",
    "  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \\\n",
    "  -p 16686:16686 \\\n",
    "  -p 4317:4317 \\\n",
    "  -p 4318:4318 \\\n",
    "  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command starts a Jaeger instance that listens on port 16686 for the Jaeger UI and port 4317 for the OpenTelemetry collector. You can access the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracing an AgentChat Team\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we will review how to enable tracing with an AutoGen GroupChat team. The AutoGen runtime already supports open telemetry (automatically logging message metadata). To begin, we will create a tracing service that will be used to instrument the AutoGen runtime.  "
