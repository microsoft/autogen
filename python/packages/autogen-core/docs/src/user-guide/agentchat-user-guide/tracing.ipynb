    "# Tracing and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen has built-in support for tracing and observability for a collecting comprehensive record on the execution of your application. This is useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding the flow of your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is powered by the [opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) library,  meaning you can use any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend to collect and analyze the traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin we need to install the OpenTelemetry Python package. You can do this using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opentelemetry-sdk  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the skd installed, the simplest way to set up tracing in AutoGen is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure an OpenTelemetry tracer provider\n",
    "- Set up an exporter to send traces to your backend\n",
    "- Connect the tracer provider to the AutoGen runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Telemetry Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect and view traces, you need to set up a telemetry backend. There are several open source available, including Jaeger, Zipkin, and Prometheus. For this example, we will use Jaeger as our telemetry backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick start, you can run Jaeger locally using Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d --name jaeger \\\n",
    "  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \\\n",
    "  -p 16686:16686 \\\n",
    "  -p 4317:4317 \\\n",
    "  -p 4318:4318 \\\n",
    "  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will start a Jaeger instance that listens on port 16686 for the Jaeger UI and port 4317 for the OpenTelemetry collector. You can access the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instrumenting an AgentChat Team \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section we will review how to enable tracing with an AutoGen GroupChat team.\n"
