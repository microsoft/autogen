    "There are several use cases where it is valuable to maintain a _store_ of useful facts that can be intelligently added to the context of the agent just before a specific step. The typically use case here is a RAG pattern where a query is used to retrieve relevant information from a database that is then added to the agent's context.\n",

    "- `add`: add new entries to the memory store\n",
    "- `query`: retrieve relevant information from the memory store \n",

    "{py:class}~autogen_core.memory.ListMemory is provided as an example implementation of the {py:class}~autogen_core.memory.Memory protocol. It is a simple list-based memory implementation that maintains memories in chronological order, appending the most recent memories to the model's context. The implementation is designed to be straightforward and predictable, making it easy to understand and debug.\n",
    "In the following example, we will use ListMemory to maintain a memory bank of user preferences and demonstrate how it can be used to provide consistent context for agent responses over time."

However, a run can go on forever, and in many cases, we need to know when to stop them. This is the role of the termination condition. AgentChat supports several termination condition by providing a base TerminationCondition class and several implementations that inherit from it. A termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of AgentEvent or ChatMessage objects since the last time the condition was called , and returns a StopMessage if the conversation should be terminated, or None otherwise. Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset by calling reset() before it can be used again. Some important things to note about termination conditions: They are stateful but reset automatically after each run ( run() or run_stream() ) is finished. They can be combined using the AND and OR operators. Note For group chat teams (i.e., RoundRobinGroupChat , SelectorGroupChat , and Swarm ), the termination condition is called after each agent responds. While a response may contain multiple inner messages, the team calls its termination condition just once for all the messages from a single response.

Note It is important to note that on_messages() will update the internal state of the agent – it will add the messages to the agent’s history. So you should call this method with new messages. You should not repeatedly call this method with the same messages or the complete history. Note Unlike in v0.2 AgentChat, the tools are executed by the same agent directly within the same call to on_messages() . By default, the agent will return the result of the tool call as the final response. You can also call the run() method, which is a convenience method that calls on_messages() . It follows the same interface as Teams and returns a TaskResult object.

However, a run can go on forever, and in many cases, we need to know when to stop them. This is the role of the termination condition. AgentChat supports several termination condition by providing a base TerminationCondition class and several implementations that inherit from it. A termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of AgentEvent or ChatMessage objects since the last time the condition was called , and returns a StopMessage if the conversation should be terminated, or None otherwise. Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset by calling reset() before it can be used again. Some important things to note about termination conditions: They are stateful but reset automatically after each run ( run() or run_stream() ) is finished. They can be combined using the AND and OR operators. Note For group chat teams (i.e., RoundRobinGroupChat , SelectorGroupChat , and Swarm ), the termination condition is called after each agent responds. While a response may contain multiple inner messages, the team calls its termination condition just once for all the messages from a single response. So the condition is called with the “delta sequence” of messages since the last time it was called.

In AgentChat, agents can interact with each other and with users to perform various tasks, including web browsing and engaging in dialogue. It utilizes models from OpenAI for chat completions and supports multi-modal input, which means agents can handle inputs that include both text and images. Additionally, AgentChat provides mechanisms to define termination conditions to control when a conversation or task should be concluded, ensuring that the agent interactions are efficient and goal-oriented.
