Each bounding box has a numeric ID label in the same color. Additional information about each visible label is listed below:

You are to respond to the most recent request by selecting an appropriate tool from the following set, or by answering the question directly if possible without tools:

{tool_names}

When deciding between tools, consider if the request can be best addressed by:
    - the contents of the current viewport (in which case actions like clicking links, clicking buttons, inputting text might be most appropriate, or hovering over element)
    - contents found elsewhere on the full webpage (in which case actions like scrolling, summarization, or full-page Q&A might be most appropriate)
