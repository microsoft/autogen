# Multi-Agent Patterns

Agents can work together in a variety of ways to solve problems.
Research works like [AutoGen](https://aka.ms/autogen-paper),
[MetaGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352)
and [ChatDev](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924) have shown
multi-agent systems out-performing single agent systems at complex tasks
like software development.

You can implement any multi-agent pattern using AGNext agents, which
communicate with each other using messages through the agent runtime.
See [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/samples#pattern-examples)
for how to implement patterns like reflection and group chat.
