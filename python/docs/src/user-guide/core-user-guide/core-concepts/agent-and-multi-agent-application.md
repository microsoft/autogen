# Agent and Multi-Agent Applications

An **agent** is a software entity that communicates via messages, maintains its own state, and performs actions in response to received messages or changes in its state. These actions may modify the agentâ€™s state and produce external effects, such as updating message logs, sending new messages, executing code, or making API calls.

Many software systems can be modeled as a collection of independent agents that interact with one another. Examples include:

- Sensors on a factory floor
- Distributed services powering web applications
- Business workflows involving multiple stakeholders
- AI agents, such as those powered by language models (e.g., GPT-4), which can write code, interface with external systems, and communicate with other agents.

These systems, composed of multiple interacting agents, are referred to as **multi-agent applications**.

> **Note:**  
> AI agents typically use language models as part of their software stack to interpret messages, perform reasoning, and execute actions.

## Characteristics of Multi-Agent Applications

In multi-agent applications, agents may:

- Run within the same process or on the same machine
- Operate across different machines or organizational boundaries
- Be implemented in diverse programming languages and make use of different AI models or instructions
- Work together towards a shared goal, coordinating their actions through messaging

Each agent is a self-contained unit that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This modular design allows agents to be reused across different scenarios and composed into more complex systems.

Agents are inherently **composable**: simple agents can be combined to form complex, adaptable applications, where each agent contributes a specific function or service to the overall system.
