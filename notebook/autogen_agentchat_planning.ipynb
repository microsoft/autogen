    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Coding and Planning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Auto-Generation#agents-experimental).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use multiple agents to work together and accomplish a task which requires finding info from the web and coding. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write and debug Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the LLM-based `AssistantAgent` with a different system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option:\n",
    "```bash\n",

      "Based on the planner's suggestions, let's tackle the first issue: \"Issue #1120: use_label_encoder warning with xgboost\". \n",
      "\n",
      "The warning is likely due to a deprecated usage in the XGBoost module that FLAML utilizes. To fix this, we need to update the call to the XGBoost module in FLAML to either stop using the label encoder or specify explicitly that the label encoder should be used, based on how FLAML is currently set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a general approach to fix this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clone the FLAML repository to your local machine.\n",
      "2. Navigate to the file where XGBoost is being called.\n",
      "3. Look for the `use_label_encoder` parameter in the XGBoost function call.\n",
      "4. If `use_label_encoder` is set to True, you can try setting it to False to see if the warning disappears.\n",
      "5. If the warning persists, it might be necessary to refactor the code to avoid using label encoding in XGBoost, or to handle label encoding before data is passed to XGBoost.\n",
      "6. After making changes, run the tests to make sure your changes do not break anything.\n",
      "7. If everything is fine, commit your changes and create a pull request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that without the actual codebase and the specific details of the issue, this is a general approach and might need to be adjusted based on the actual code and setup of FLAML. \n",
