    "# Chatting with TeachableAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TeachableAgent` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memory is saved to disk at the end of each chat, then loaded from disk at the start of the next. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the agent just once, and have the agent remember them in later chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `TeachableAgent` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `TeachableAgent` can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat with `TeachableAgent` yourself, run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](../test/agentchat/chat_with_teachable_agent.py).\n",

      "Abstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI's correctness likelihood (CL) but ignored humans' CL, hindering optimal team decision-making. To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans' appropriate trust based on the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans' CL by approximating their decision-making models and computing their potential performance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three CL exploitation strategies to calibrate users' trust explicitly/implicitly in the AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more appropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We further provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted decision-making.\n",

      "2. Title: Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration in AI-Assisted Decision Making\n",
      "Abstract: Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately \\textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.\n",

      "Abstract: How much are we to trust a decision made by an AI algorithm? Trusting an algorithm without cause may lead to abuse, and mistrusting it may similarly lead to disuse. Trust in an AI is only desirable if it is warranted; thus, calibrating trust is critical to ensuring appropriate use. In the name of calibrating trust appropriately, AI developers should provide contracts specifying use cases in which an algorithm can and cannot be trusted. Automated explanation of AI outputs is often touted as a method by which trust can be built in the algorithm. However, automated explanations arise from algorithms themselves, so trust in these explanations is similarly only desirable if it is warranted. Developers of algorithms explaining AI outputs (xAI algorithms) should provide similar contracts, which should specify use cases in which an explanation can and cannot be trusted.\n",

      "4. Title: A Systematic Literature Review of User Trust in AI-Enabled Systems: An HCI Perspective\n",
      "Abstract: User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It has been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric approaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core principle of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to provide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and measurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future technical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the user AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to define trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by three main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design features, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings, reinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to monitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding the optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.\n",

      "5. Title: Trust Calibration and Trust Respect: A Method for Building Team Cohesion in Human Robot Teams\n",
      "Abstract: Recent advances in the areas of human-robot interaction (HRI) and robot autonomy are changing the world. Today robots are used in a variety of applications. People and robots work together in human autonomous teams (HATs) to accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust between robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective team cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI, human trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the robotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low performance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task failures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is also important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is exhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger, distraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to calibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to respect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human should trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its feedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust calibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans. This information is potentially useful in aiding a robot it its decision to respect trust.\n",

Simultaneously, the human factors literature has long addressed important considerations that contribute to human performance, including human trust in autonomous systems. In this paper, drawing from the human factors literature, we discuss three important trust-related considerations for the design of explainable robot systems: the bases of trust, trust calibration, and trust specificity. We further detail existing and potential metrics for assessing trust in robotic systems based on explanations provided by explainable robots.\n",

      "Abstract: The dazzling promises of AI systems to augment humans in various tasks hinge on whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown that appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team performance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an under-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people can hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive bias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and performance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of DKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be mitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI advice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user understanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their performance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal team performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either improving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate reliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users calibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among participants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can potentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated self-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to tackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI systems. Our findings advance the current understanding of the role of self-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This lays out promising future directions for relevant HCI research in this community.\n",

      "Abstract: A central goal of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the trust relationship in human-AI interaction. One assumption underlying research in transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess predictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to identify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however shows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative metric for XAI methods based on Turing's imitation game, a Turing Test for Transparency. A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was generated by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can not be detected by humans above chance performance in this binary classification task are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a requirement for assessing and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI interaction. We present experimental results on a crowd-sourced text classification task demonstrating that even for basic ML models and XAI approaches most participants were not able to differentiate human from machine generated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical implications of our results for applications of transparent ML.\n",

To help users make the right decisions about the information they're getting, LLMs should not only provide but also help users fact-check information. In this paper, we conduct experiments with 80 crowdworkers in total to compare language models with search engines (information retrieval systems) at facilitating fact-checking by human users. We prompt LLMs to validate a given claim and provide corresponding explanations. Users reading LLM explanations are significantly more efficient than using search engines with similar accuracy. However, they tend to over-rely the LLMs when the explanation is wrong. To reduce over-reliance on LLMs, we ask LLMs to provide contrastive information -\n",
