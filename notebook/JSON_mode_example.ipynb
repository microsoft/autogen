    "# Mitigating Prompt hacking with JSON Mode in Autogen\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to generate very precise agent responses using a combination of OpenAI JSON mode and the Agent Description. \n",
    "\n",
    "As our example, we will implement prompt hacking protection by controlling how agents can respond; Filtering coercive requests to an agent that will always reject their requests. \n",
    "The strucutre of JSON mode both enables precise speaker selection and allows us to add a \"coersiveness rating\" to a request that the groupchat manager can use to filter out bad requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "The group chat manager can perfrom some simple maths encoded into the agent descriptions on the rating values (made reliable by json mode) and direct requests deemed too coersive to the \"suspicious agent\" \n",

    "Benefits\n",
    "- This contribution provides a method to implement precise speaker transitions based on content of the input message. The example can prevent Prompt hacks that use coersive language.\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "JSON mode is a feature of OpenAI API, however strong models (such as claude 3 Opus), can generate appropriate json as well.\n",
    "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install:\n",
