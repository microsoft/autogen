    "# Using MathChat to Solve Math Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "MathChat is a convesational framework for math problem solving. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use MathChat to solve math problems. MathChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and `MathUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (More details in `autogen_agent_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb`). Essentially, `MathUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the MathChat prompts. The original implementation and exeperiments of MathChat are in this [branch](https://github.com/kevin666aa/FLAML/tree/gpt_math_solver/flaml/autogen/math), and you can find more details in our paper [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337).\n",
