Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).

      "1. **Improved decision-making in intensive care units (ICUs):** By providing explainability for its predictions regarding patient mortality, clinicians can understand the reasoning behind AI-driven prognoses and make more informed treatment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhanced clinician trust in AI technologies:** Explainable outputs can build clinician trust in AI systems, thereby potentially increasing the adoption of AI tools in critical care settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Identification of crucial health factors:** The framework assists in discovering important factors in healthcare research, possibly leading to new insights into patient care and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Education and training:** The visualizations and explanations provided by X-MMP could be used in medical education and training, helping healthcare professionals to better understand the factors influencing patient outcomes in the ICU.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Transferability to other clinical tasks:** The framework can be adapted to other clinical prediction tasks, making it a versatile tool for various applications within the healthcare domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Contribution analysis of multimodal data:** Understanding how various types of data (vitals, lab results, waveforms, etc.) influence predictions can lead to better multimodal data integration in clinical workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper showcases how explainable AI can directly impact healthcare by enhancing the transparency and interpretability of AI models, ultimately supporting clinical decision-making and patient care. The application of such technology could be pivotal in advancing personalized medicine and tailored treatment plans for patients in critical conditions. \n",
