The RGF has many tuning parameters, the most critical of which are: `[max_leaf, n_iter, n_tree_search, opt_interval, min_samples_leaf]`. To run a customized/new learner, the user needs to provide the following information:\n",

        "* a list of hyperparameter names and types\n",
        "* rough ranges of hyperparameters (i.e., upper/lower bounds)\n",
