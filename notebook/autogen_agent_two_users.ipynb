    "# Multi-Agent Human-in-the-loop Application\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate an application involving multiple agents and human users to work together and accomplish a task. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We create multiple `UserProxyAgent` instances which can represent different human users.\n",

    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option:\n",
