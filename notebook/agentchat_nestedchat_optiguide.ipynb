    "Several utility functions (replace, insert_code, run_with_exec) are defined to manipulate and execute the source code dynamically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **replace(src_code, old_code, new_code) -> str:**<br/>Replaces a specified block of code within the source code with new code. This is essential for updating the code dynamically based on chatbot and user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **insert_code(src_code, new_lines) -> str:**<br/>Determines where to insert new lines of code based on specific markers in the source code. It's used to seamlessly integrate generated code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **run_with_exec(src_code) -> Union[str, Exception]:**<br/>Executes the modified source code within a controlled environment, capturing and returning the output or any errors that occur. This function is crucial for testing the feasibility and correctness of the generated code solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions External Code Retrieval\n",
    "The cell also includes logic to retrieve example source code from a remote repository using the requests library. This example code serves as a base for the chatbot to work with, allowing users to see real-life applications of the concepts discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieved code is then displayed, showing both the beginning and the end of the source code to give a glimpse of its structure and content."

This streamlines the process of generating, evaluating, and integrating code solutions for supply chain optimization problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`OptiGuide`**: Inherits from `autogen.AssistantAgent` and serves as the main class for handling the supply chain optimization logic. It maintains state information like the source code, debugging attempts left, success status, and user chat history. Key methods include `set_success` and `update_debug_times`, which are used to update the agent's state based on the outcomes of interactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Agent Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`writer`**, **`safeguard`**, and **`optiguide_commander`**: Instances of the classes defined above, each configured with specific roles in the code generation and evaluation process. These agents work together to ensure that the user's questions are answered with safe, optimized, and understandable Python code solutions.\n",
