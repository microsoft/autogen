    "# Interactive LLM Agent with Auto Feedback from Code Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and `max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits feedback from the human user or uses auto-feedback based on the result of code execution. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent` without doing any additional steps. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.7`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option:\n",
    "```bash\n",

This process involves constructing a `AssistantAgent` to serve as the assistant, along with a `UserProxyAgent` that acts as a proxy for the human user.
