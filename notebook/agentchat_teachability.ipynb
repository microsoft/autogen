    "# Chatting with a teachable agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional agent capability called `Teachability` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memories (called memos) are created and saved to disk throughout a conversation, then loaded from disk later. Instead of copying all the memos into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memos are retrieved into context only as needed. This allows the user to teach many facts, preferences and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it remember them in later chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `Teachability` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `Teachability` can be added to an agent so that it can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat with a teachable agent yourself, run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/agentchat/contrib/capabilities/chat_with_teachable_agent.py).\n",

Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.\n",

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

      "1. Get the current total of the equation, which we already know equals 72.\n",
      "2. Identify the target total, which we want to be 99.\n",

      "4. Inspect each of the four terms on the left (9, 4, 6, and 6), and see if changing one of them can bring us to our target total.\n",
      "5. We need a change that will add 27 to the left side. This means thinking about the factors and multiples related to each term.\n",
      "6. We'll consider the impact of increasing or decreasing each term and see which modification gets us to add 27 exactly.\n",

      "\n",
      "- If we increase or decrease the first term '9', which gets multiplied by '4', we could change '9' to '9 + a', where 'a' is some integer. But since we'll multiply by '4', this change wouldn't give us an additional 27 unless 'a' was a fraction, which is not permitted as we are only modifying integers.\n",
      "- The second term '4' is multiplied by '9'. If we changed '4' to '5', we would add '9' to the sum, which is not enough; changing '4' to '6' would mean adding '18', which is also not enough.\n",
      "- If we change one of the sixes being multiplied by '6', then we could consider turning one '6' into '9'. This would add '3 * 6 = 18' to the sum, which is too small of an increment as well.\n",
      "- The largest increase we can get is by changing the '6' that is being multiplied by itself, meaning '6 * 6'. If we change one '6' to '9', then we get '9 * 6', which increases the sum by '3 * 6' = 18, which doesn't achieve the desired 27.\n",
      "- But if we take the approach of changing a '6' that multiplies the '9' to a '9', thus making it '9 * 9', we add '3 * 9' = 27, exactly what we need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this logic, we can modify the second '6' that is being multiplied by the '9'. So we change '9 * 4 + 6 * 6' to '9 * 4 + 9 * 6'.\n",
