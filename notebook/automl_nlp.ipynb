    "# FineTuning NLP Models with FLAML Library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML is a Python library (https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML) designed to automatically produce accurate machine learning models \n",
    "with low computational cost. It is fast and economical. The simple and lightweight design makes it easy to use and extend, such as adding new learners. FLAML can \n",
    "- serve as an economical AutoML engine,\n",
    "- be used as a fast hyperparameter tuning tool, or \n",
    "- be embedded in self-tuning software that requires low latency & resource in repetitive\n",
    "   tuning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use the FLAML library to fine tune an NLP language model with hyperparameter search. We will use [flaml.tune](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function) with the built in GPU in colab for the tuning. However, if you have a machine with more than 1 GPU, you can also use FLAML's [parallel tuning](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) with the ray tune option. \n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.7`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the `[automl,hf,blendsearch]` option:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install flaml[automl,hf,blendsearch]; \n",
    "```"

    "- Document: Army explosives experts were called out to deal with a suspect package at the offices on the Newtownards Road on Friday night. Roads were sealed off and traffic diverted as a controlled explosion was carried out. The premises, used by East Belfast MP Naomi Long, have been targeted a number of times. Most recently, petrol bomb attacks were carried out on the offices on consecutive nights in April and May. The attacks began following a Belfast City Council vote in December 2012 restricting the flying of the union flag at the City Hall. Condemning the latest hoax, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: \"It is a serious incident for the local area, it causes serious disruption, it puts people's lives at risk, it can prevent emergency services reaching the area. \"Ultimately we need people with information to share that with the police in order for them to do their job and bring these people to justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary: A suspicious package left outside an Alliance Party office in east Belfast has been declared a hoax.\n",

    "In this example, we use FLAML to perform *abstractive summarization* using the t5-small language model, i.e., the summary is generated word-by-word. "
