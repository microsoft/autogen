    "\n",
    "FLAML is a Python library (https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML) designed to automatically produce accurate machine learning models with low computational cost. It is fast and economical. The simple and lightweight design makes it easy to use and extend, such as adding new learners. FLAML can\n",
    "\n",
    " - serve as an economical AutoML engine,\n",
    " - be used as a fast hyperparameter tuning tool, or\n",
    " - be embedded in self-tuning software that requires low latency & resource in repetitive tuning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use FLAML library for time series forecasting tasks: univariate time series forecasting (only time), multivariate time series forecasting (with exogneous variables) and forecasting discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires Python>=3.6. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the notebook and forecast option:\n"
