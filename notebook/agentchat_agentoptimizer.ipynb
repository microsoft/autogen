    "# AgentOptimizer: An Agentic Way to Train Your LLM Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional ML pipeline, we train a model by updating its parameter according to the loss on the training set, while in the era of LLM agents, how should we train an agent? Here, we take an initial step towards the agent training. Inspired by the [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) capabilities provided by OpenAI, we draw an analogy between model parameters and agent functions/skills, and update agent’s functions/skills based on its historical performance on the training set. As an agentic way of training an agent, our approach help enhance the agents’ abilities without requiring access to the LLMs parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce a new class, ‘AgentOptimizer’, which is able to improve the function list of one Assistant-UserProxy pair according to the historical conversation histories. This feature would support agents in improving their ability to solve problems of the same type as previous tasks.\n",
    "Specifically, given a set of training data, AgentOptimizer would iteratively prompt the LLM to optimize the existing function list of the AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent with code implementation if necessary.\n",
    "In the example scenario, we test the proposed AgentOptimizer in solving problems from the [MATH dataset](https://github.com/hendrycks/math). \n",

    "AgentOptimizer is a class that is designed to improve the agents through optimizing its function call. It contains two core methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `step()`: `step()` has three inputs: previous conversation history (history), the statistical information of solving previous problems (statistic), and the signature of current functions (func_signature). The output is a series of actions to manipulate the current functions.\n",

    "    OPT_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a function optimizer. Your task is to maintain a list of functions for the assistant according to the existing function list and conversation history that happens between the assistant and the user. \n",
    "You can perform one of the following four actions to manipulate the function list using the functions you have: \n",
    "1. Revise one existing function (using revise_function). \n",
    "2. Remove one existing function (using remove_function).\n",
    "3. Add one new function (using add_function).\n",
    "4. Directly return \"TERMINATE\" to me if no more actions are needed for the current function list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the principles that you need to follow for taking these four actions.\n",
    "(1) Revise one existing function:\n",
    "1. Pay more attention to the failed tasks and corresponding error information, and optimize the function used in these tasks according to the conversation history if needed.\n",
    "2. A failed function call can occur due to incorrect input arguments (missing arguments) or an incorrect function code implementation. You should focus more on the function code implementation and make it easy to get success function call.\n",
    "3. Do not revise the function that you think works well and plays a critical role in solving the problems according to the conversation history. Only making revisions if needed.\n",
    "4. Sometimes, a NameError may occur. To fix this error, you can either revise the name of the function in the code implementation or revise the name of the function call to make these two names consistent.\n",
    "(2) Remove one existing function:\n",
    "1. Only remove the function that you think is not needed anymore in future tasks. \n",
    "(3) Add one new function:\n",
    "1. The added new function should solve a higher-level question that encompasses the original query and extend the code's functionality to make it more versatile and widely applicable.  \n",
    "2. The added new function should solve queries of the same type, based on common reasoning steps without mentioning specific object names or entity terms.\n",
    "3. Name the function and write the description concerning both the core reasoning pattern and data organization format, without referencing specific objects. The name of the function MUST be the same with the function name in the code you generated.\n",
    "4. Replace specific strings or variable names with general variables to enhance the tool's applicability to various queries. All names used inside the function should be passed in as arguments. \n",
    "(4) Directly return \"TERMINATE\":\n",
    "If you think there is no need to perform any other actions for the current function list since the current list is optimal more actions will harm the performance in future tasks. Please directly reply to me with \"TERMINATE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One function signature includes the following five elements:\n",
    "1. Function name \n",
    "2. Function description \n",
    "3. JSON schema of arguments encoded as a string\n",
    "4. A list of package names imported by the function packages \n",
    "5. The code implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the signatures of the current functions:\n",
    "List A: {signiture}. \n",
    "The success rate (performance) with this function list is {success_rate}.\n",
