To all our collaborators and community members,

There have been a number of asks to clarify and distinguish between various AutoGen forks and clones and the current `pyautogen` package. Here are some important things to know:

The official GitHub repository for the AutoGen project is still [github.com/microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). We are actively working on and maintaining AutoGen 0.2 and have recently introduced new innovations to AutoGen 0.4 (AutoGen-Core, Autogen-AgentChat), as well as AutoGen-Studio and Magentic-One as part of the project’s roadmap. Development will continue in the open-source under the MIT license. We are grateful to all past contributors and welcome anyone to use or contribute to the project.

We are currently restructuring our python packages, see details here. Unfortunately, admin **access to `pyautogen` is currently blocked for us. Please be aware that the current version of `pyautogen` is not affiliated with the microsoft/autogen project.**

We are unable to communicate on the original AutoGen Discord server, since many of our members no longer have viewing or posting permissions there. For inquiries and discussions, please reach out to us on GitHub Discussions, via email at `autogen@microsoft.com`, our new [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc) or join our community office hours on Wednesdays 10am PST/1pm EST/7pm CET at – [Teams meeting link](https://aka.ms/autogen-officehour).

Since its creation, AutoGen has been a highly collaborative project and most of the team behind AutoGen from day one continues to be deeply involved today. While we want to clarify that no one at Microsoft is involved with any forks or clones of this project, we recognize that **these variations reflect the diverse interests and evolving business endeavors in the community**. Our team continues to remain dedicated to working with the amazing community that has helped shape this project.

Thank you for your continued support and stay tuned for new releases coming soon.
