    "A two-agent chats takes two inputs: a message, which is a string provided by\n",
    "the caller; a context, which specifies various parameters of the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent uses its chat initializer method\n",
    "(i.e., `generate_init_message` method of `ConversableAgent`)\n",
    "to generate an initial message from the inputs, and\n",
    "sends it to the recipient agent to start the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent is the agent whose `initiate_chat` method is called, and\n",
    "the recipient agent is the other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the chat terminates, the history of the chat is processed by a \n",
    "chat summarizer. The summarizer summarizes the chat history and calculates\n",
    "the token usage of the chat. \n",
    "You can configure the type of summary using the `summary_method`\n",

With the rise of prompt-based\\nservices, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers often\\ndisplay prompts' capabilities through input-output examples to attract users.\\nHowever, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure of\\ninput-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on the\\nintellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problem\\nstill has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in this\\npaper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attack\\nframework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA.\\nThe main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of the\\ninput-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. In\\ndetail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt\\npruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based\\non differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectively\\ninferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and mask\\nthe words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodate\\ndiverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify that\\nPRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios. We have reported these\\nfindings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to take\\nprotective measures for prompt copyright.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations\\n  for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Paul Röttger, Valentin Hofmann, Valentina Pyatkin, Musashi Hinck, Hannah Rose Kirk, Hinrich Schütze, Dirk Hovy\\nAbstract: Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language\\nmodels (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this\\nwork is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example,\\npolitically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by\\nmillions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast\\nto the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask\\nLLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the\\nprevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and\\nexplore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on\\nthe popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that\\nmost prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's\\nmultiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different\\nanswers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are\\nforced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that\\nmodels give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer\\nsetting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in\\nevaluating values and opinions in LLMs.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for\\n  Personal Mobility Generation\\nAuthors: Jiawei Wang, Renhe Jiang, Chuang Yang, Zengqing Wu, Makoto Onizuka, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Chuan Xiao\\nAbstract: This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nintegrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility\\ngeneration. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently\\nprocessing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks.\\nOur approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban\\nmobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich\\nactivity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and\\nexploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is\\na novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and\\nmotivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with\\nreal-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable\\nactivity generation. In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is\\nperformed using real-world data. This research marks the pioneering work of\\ndesigning an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world\\nhuman activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: An Evaluation of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics Research\\nAuthors: Hengchuang Yin, Zhonghui Gu, Fanhao Wang, Yiparemu Abuduhaibaier, Yanqiao Zhu, Xinming Tu, Xian-Sheng Hua, Xiao Luo, Yizhou Sun\\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have gained considerable\\ninterest across diverse research communities. Their notable ability for text\\ncompletion and generation has inaugurated a novel paradigm for\\nlanguage-interfaced problem solving. However, the potential and efficacy of\\nthese models in bioinformatics remain incompletely explored. In this work, we\\nstudy the performance LLMs on a wide spectrum of crucial bioinformatics tasks.\\nThese tasks include the identification of potential coding regions, extraction\\nof named entities for genes and proteins, detection of antimicrobial and\\nanti-cancer peptides, molecular optimization, and resolution of educational\\nbioinformatics problems. Our findings indicate that, given appropriate prompts,\\nLLMs like GPT variants can successfully handle most of these tasks. In\\naddition, we provide a thorough analysis of their limitations in the context of\\ncomplicated bioinformatics tasks. In conclusion, we believe that this work can\\nprovide new perspectives and motivate future research in the field of LLMs\\napplications, AI for Science and bioinformatics.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13714v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Da Yu, Peter Kairouz, Sewoong Oh, Zheng Xu\\nAbstract: Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user\\ninstructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with users'\\nintentions. These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive\\ninformation, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new\\nprivacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we\\npropose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data\\nannotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by\\ngenerating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators.\\nCrucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that\\nmatches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real\\nones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human\\nfeedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final\\nset of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real\\ninstructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic\\ninstructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13659v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in\\n  Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru\\nAuthors: Zining Wang, Paul Reisert, Eric Nichols, Randy Gomez\\nAbstract: Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging\\nconversation. However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on\\nscripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations.\\nThis paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models\\n(LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations.\\nWe introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to\\ngenerate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's\\npersonality. We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a\\ntext-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a\\nlibrary of physical actions for the robot. We develop a custom,\\nstate-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's\\ntone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot\\nactions. A demo of our system is available here. To illuminate design and\\nimplementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a\\nsocial robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback,\\nconducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. Feedback was\\noverwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy,\\nhelpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment. Most negative feedback was due to\\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on\\nconversations. However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM\\nrepeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses,\\nthat have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for\\nLLM application.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence Chatbots\\n  in Ophthalmology and LLM-based evaluation using GPT-4\\nAuthors: Ting Fang Tan, Kabilan Elangovan, Liyuan Jin, Yao Jie, Li Yong, Joshua Lim, Stanley Poh, Wei Yan Ng, Daniel Lim, Yuhe Ke, Nan Liu, Daniel Shu Wei Ting\\nAbstract: Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician\\nexperts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient\\nqueries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots.

An important application area is question answering over private\\nenterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which\\nnecessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational\\nresources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to\\nqueries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent\\nframework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is\\nrelatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application\\nrequires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the\\napplication domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM\\napplication for question answering over private organizational documents. Our\\napplication combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM.\\nAdditionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure\\nto represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to\\ngenerate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user\\nqueries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our\\nevaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or\\nfinetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our\\nexperiences building an LLM application for real-world use.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483v1\\n\\n\\n\", 'name': 'Retrieve_Action_2', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Based on the retrieved abstracts, here is a markdown table categorizing the papers by domain, along with their titles, authors, summaries, and links:\\n\\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | Link |\\n|--------|-------|---------|---------|------|\\n| Security | PRSA: Prompt Reverse Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models | Yong Yang, Xuhong Zhang, Yi Jiang, Xi Chen, Haoyu Wang, Shouling Ji, Zonghui Wang | The paper explores the security risks associated with exposing input-output pairs of prompts used in LLMs and proposes a novel attack framework, PRSA, to reverse-steal prompts, posing a threat to intellectual property rights. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200v1) |\\n| Ethics & Evaluation | Political Compass or Spinning Arrow?
