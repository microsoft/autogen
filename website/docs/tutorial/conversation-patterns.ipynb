    "# Conversation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we used two-agent conversation, which\n",
    "can be started by the `initiate_chat` method.\n",
    "Two-agent chat is a useful conversation pattern but AutoGen offers more.\n",
    "In this chapter, we will first dig a little bit more into the two-agent \n",
    "chat pattern and chat result, \n",
    "then we will show you several conversation patterns that involve \n",
    "more than two agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two-agent chat**: the simplest form of conversation pattern where two agents chat with each other.\n",
    "2. **Sequential chat**: a sequence of chats between two agents, chained together by a carryover mechanism, which brings the summary of the previous chat to the context of the next chat.\n",
    "3. **Group Chat**: a single chat involving more than two agents. An important question in group chat is: What agent should be next to speak? To support different scenarios, we provide different ways to organize agents in a group chat:\n",
    "    - We support several strategies to select the next agent: `round_robin`, `random`, `manual` (human selection), and `auto` (Default, using an LLM to decide).\n",
    "    - We provide a way to constrain the selection of the next speaker (See examples below).\n",
    "    - We allow you to pass in a function to customize the selection of the next speaker. With this feature, you can build a **StateFlow** model which allows a deterministic workflow among your agents.\n",
    " Please refer to this [guide](/docs/topics/groupchat/customized_speaker_selection) and this [blog post](/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow) on StateFlow for more details.\n",
    "4. **Nested Chat**: package a workflow into a single agent for reuse in a larger workflow."

    "Two-agent chat is the simplest form of conversation pattern. \n",
    "We start a two-agent chat using the `initiate_chat` method of every \n",
    "`ConversableAgent` agent.\n",
    "We have already\n",
    "seen multiple examples of two-agent chats in previous chapters\n",

    "A two-agent chats takes two inputs: a message, which is a string provided by\n",
    "the caller; a context, which specifies various parameters of the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent uses its chat initializer method\n",
    "(i.e., `generate_init_message` method of `ConversableAgent`)\n",
    "to generate an initial message from the inputs, and\n",
    "sends it to the recipient agent to start the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent is the agent whose `initiate_chat` method is called, and\n",
    "the recipient agent is the other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the chat terminates, the history of the chat is processed by a \n",
    "chat summarizer. The summarizer summarizes the chat history and calculates\n",
    "the token usage of the chat. \n",
    "You can configure the type of summary using the `summary_method`\n",
    "parameter of the `initiate_chat` method. By default, it is the last\n",
    "message of the chat (i.e., `summary_method='last_msg'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below is a two-agent chat between a student agent and a teacher\n",
    "agent. Its summarizer uses an LLM-based summary."
