    "# Allowing Human Feedback in Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two chapters we introduced the `ConversableAgent` class and showed how you can use it to create autonomous (`human_input_mode=NEVER`) agents that can accomplish tasks. We also showed how to properly terminate a conversation between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "But many applications may require putting humans in-the-loop with agents. For example, to allow human feedback to steer agents in the right direction, specify goals, etc. In this chapter, we will show how AutoGen supports human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AutoGen's `ConversableAgent`, the human-in-the-loop component sits in front\n",
    "of the auto-reply components. It can intercept the incoming messages and\n",
    "decide whether to pass them to the auto-reply components or to provide\n",
    "human feedback. The figure below illustrates the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "![Human in the loop](./assets/human-in-the-loop.png)\n",

    "\n",

    "## Human Input Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently AutoGen supports three modes for human input. The mode is specified through\n",
    "the `human_input_mode` argument of the `ConversableAgent`. The three modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `NEVER`: human input is never requested.\n",
    "2. `TERMINATE` (default): human input is only requested when a termination condition is\n",
    "    met. Note that in this mode if the human chooses to intercept and reply, the conversation continues\n",
    "    and the counter used by `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is reset.\n",
    "3. `ALWAYS`: human input is always requested and the human can choose to skip and trigger an auto-reply,\n",
    "    intercept and provide feedback, or terminate the conversation. Note that in this mode\n",
    "    termination based on `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters already showed many examples of the cases when `human_input_mode` is `NEVER`. \n",
    "Below we show one such example again and then show the differences when this mode is set to `ALWAYS` and `NEVER` instead."
