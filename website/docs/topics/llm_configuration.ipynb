    "- If `env_or_file` is an environment variable then:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why is it a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a list allows you to define multiple models that can be used by the agent. This is useful for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one model times out or fails, the agent can try another model.\n",
    "- Having a single global list of models and [filtering it](#config-list-filtering) based on certain keys (e.g. name, tag) in order to pass select models into a certain agent (e.g. use cheaper GPT 3.5 for agents solving easier tasks)\n",
    "- While the core agents, (e.g. conversable or assistant) do not have special logic around selecting configs, some of the specialized agents *may* have logic to select the best model based on the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does an agent decide which model to pick out of the list?\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent uses the very first model available in the \"config_list\" and makes LLM calls against this model. If the model fails (e.g. API throttling) the agent will retry the request against the 2nd model and so on until prompt completion is received (or throws an error if none of the models successfully completes the request). In general there's no implicit/hidden logic inside agents that is used to pick \"the best model for the task\". However, some specialized agents may attempt to choose \"the best model for the task\". It is developers responsibility to pick the right models and use them with agents.\n",
