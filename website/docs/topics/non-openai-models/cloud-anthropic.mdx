# Anthropic Claude
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website\docs\topics\non-openai-models\cloud-anthropic.ipynb)
[![Open on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20GitHub-grey?logo=github)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website\docs\topics\non-openai-models\cloud-anthropic.ipynb)





In the v0.2.30 release of AutoGen we support Anthropic Client.

Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic and
designed to revolutionize the way you interact with AI. Claude excels at
a wide variety of tasks involving language, reasoning, analysis, coding,
and more. The models are highly capable, easy to use, and can be
customized to suit your needs.

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Anthropic Claude model for
AgentChat in AutoGen.

## Features

Additionally, this client class provides support for function/tool
calling and will track token usage and cost correctly as per Anthropic’s
API costs (as of June 2024).

## Requirements

To use Anthropic Claude with AutoGen, first you need to install the
`pyautogen["anthropic]` package.

To try out the function call feature of Claude model, you need to
install `anthropic>=0.23.1`.

```python
# !pip install pyautogen
!pip install pyautogen["anthropic"]
```

## Set the config for the Anthropic API

You can add any parameters that are needed for the custom model loading
in the same configuration list.

It is important to add the `api_type` field and set it to a string that
corresponds to the client type used: `anthropic`.

Example:

``` text
[
    {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        "api_key": "your Anthropic API Key goes here",
        "api_type": "anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        "api_key": "your Anthropic API Key goes here",
        "api_type": "anthropic",
        "temperature": 0.5,
        "top_p": 0.2, # Note: It is recommended to set temperature or top_p but not both.
        "max_tokens": 10000,
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-3-opus-20240229",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-2.0",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-2.1",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-3.0-haiku",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
]
```

### Alternative

As an alternative to the api_key key and value in the config, you can
set the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your Anthropic API
key.

Linux/Mac:

``` text
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your Anthropic API key here"
```

Windows:

``` text
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

```python
import os

from typing_extensions import Annotated

import autogen

config_list_claude = [
    {
        # Choose your model name.
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        # You need to provide your API key here.
        "api_key": os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
        "api_type": "anthropic",
    }
]
```

## Two-agent Coding Example

### Construct Agents

Construct a simple conversation between a User proxy and an
ConversableAgent based on Claude-3 model.

```python
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    "assistant",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list_claude,
    },
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "coding",
        "use_docker": False,
    },
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=1,
)
```

### Initiate Chat

```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant, message="Write a python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence."
)
```

```` text
user_proxy (to assistant):

Write a python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Certainly! I'll write a Python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Here's the code:

```python
# filename: fibonacci.py

def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        next_number = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_number)
    
    return fib_sequence

# Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
n = 10
result = fibonacci(n)
print(f"The first {n} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:")
print(result)
```

This program does the following:

1. We define a function called `fibonacci` that takes an argument `n`, which is the number of Fibonacci numbers we want to generate.
2. We initialize the `fib_sequence` list with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.
3. We use a while loop to generate subsequent numbers in the sequence by adding the last two numbers until we have `n` numbers in the sequence.
4. We return the complete Fibonacci sequence.
5. Outside the function, we set `n = 10` to get the first 10 numbers.
6. We call the `fibonacci` function with `n = 10` and store the result in the `result` variable.
7. Finally, we print the result.

Let's run this code and see the output. The code will be saved in a file named "fibonacci.py". You can execute it using Python.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...
user_proxy (to assistant):

exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output: 
The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Excellent! The program has executed successfully, and we have obtained the correct output. Let's verify the result:

The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are indeed:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

This is correct because:
1. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
2. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
3. We can verify this by checking a few numbers:
   - 1 = 0 + 1
   - 2 = 1 + 1
   - 3 = 1 + 2
   - 5 = 2 + 3
   - 8 = 3 + 5
   and so on...

The program has successfully generated and printed the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The task is completed correctly.
