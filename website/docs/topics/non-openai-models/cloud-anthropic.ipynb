    "Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic and designed to revolutionize the way you interact with AI. Claude excels at a wide variety of tasks involving language, reasoning, analysis, coding, and more. The models are highly capable, easy to use, and can be customized to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Anthropic Claude model for AgentChat in AutoGen.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this client class provides support for function/tool calling and will track token usage and cost correctly as per Anthropic's API costs (as of June 2024).\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "To use Anthropic Claude with AutoGen, first you need to install the `pyautogen[anthropic]` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out the function call feature of Claude model, you need to install `anthropic>=0.23.1`.\n"
