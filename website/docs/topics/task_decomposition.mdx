# Task Decomposition
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website\docs\topics\task_decomposition.ipynb)
[![Open on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20GitHub-grey?logo=github)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website\docs\topics\task_decomposition.ipynb)





On this page, we demonstrate several different ways to achieve task
decomposition in AutoGen.

First make sure the `pyautogen` package is installed.

```python
! pip install "pyautogen>=0.2.18"
```

Import the relevant modules and configure the LLM. See [LLM
Configuration](./llm_configuration) for how to configure LLMs.

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Callable, Dict, Literal, Optional, Union

from typing_extensions import Annotated

from autogen import (
    Agent,
    AssistantAgent,
    ConversableAgent,
    GroupChat,
    GroupChatManager,
    UserProxyAgent,
    config_list_from_json,
    register_function,
)
from autogen.agentchat.contrib import agent_builder
from autogen.cache import Cache
from autogen.coding import DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor, LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

config_list = [
    {"model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]},
    {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]},
]
# You can also use the following method to load the config list from a file or environment variable.
# config_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")
```

The task to be solved to write a blog post about the stock price
performance of Nvidia in the past month.

```python
task = (
    f"Today is {datetime.now().date()}. Write a blogpost about the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month."
)
print(task)
```

``` text
Today is 2024-03-18. Write a blogpost about the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month.
```

## Approach 1. Two-agent chat with function call for task decomposition {#approach-1.-two-agent-chat-with-function-call-for-task-decomposition}

In this approach, we use a planner agent for coming up a plan. The
planner agent is wrapped inside a function to be used as a tool.

```python
# Create planner agent.
planner = AssistantAgent(
    name="planner",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list,
        "cache_seed": None,  # Disable legacy cache.
    },
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant. You suggest a feasible plan "
    "for finishing a complex task by decomposing it into 3-5 sub-tasks. "
    "If the plan is not good, suggest a better plan. "
    "If the execution is wrong, analyze the error and suggest a fix.",
)

# Create a planner user agent used to interact with the planner.
planner_user = UserProxyAgent(
    name="planner_user",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
)

# The function for asking the planner.


def task_planner(question: Annotated[str, "Question to ask the planner."]) -> str:
    with Cache.disk(cache_seed=4) as cache:
        planner_user.initiate_chat(planner, message=question, max_turns=1, cache=cache)
    # return the last message received from the planner
    return planner_user.last_message()["content"]
```

Next, we create an assistant agent to execute the plan, using the
planner agent as a tool.

```python
# Create assistant agent.
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant. "
    "You can use the task planner to decompose a complex task into sub-tasks. "
    "Make sure your follow through the sub-tasks. "
    "When needed, write Python code in markdown blocks, and I will execute them."
    "Give the user a final solution at the end. "
    "Return TERMINATE only if the sub-tasks are completed.",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list,
        "cache_seed": None,  # Disable legacy cache.
    },
)

# Setting up code executor.
os.makedirs("planning", exist_ok=True)
# Use DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor to run code in a docker container.
# code_executor = DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir="planning")
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir="planning")

# Create user proxy agent used to interact with the assistant.
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: "content" in x
    and x["content"] is not None
    and x["content"].rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor},
)

# Register the function to the agent pair.
register_function(
    task_planner,
    caller=assistant,
    executor=user_proxy,
    name="task_planner",
    description="A task planner than can help you with decomposing a complex task into sub-tasks.",
)
```


```python
# Use Cache.disk to cache LLM responses. Change cache_seed for different responses.
with Cache.disk(cache_seed=1) as cache:
    # the assistant receives a message from the user, which contains the task description
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        assistant,
        message=task,
        cache=cache,
    )
```

How to gather data on Nvidia's stock price over the past month?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
planner (to planner_user):

To gather data on Nvidia's stock price over the past month, you can decompose the task into the following sub-tasks:

1. **Define Your Source:**
   - Decide where you will obtain the data (e.g., financial websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Bloomberg, or utilizing APIs from services like Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Quandl).

2. **Data Collection:**
   - If you have chosen a financial website, you can usually download historical stock price data directly. Look for a "Download Data" or similar option on the webpage that shows Nvidia's stock history.
   - If using an API, write a script or use a tool to access the API, request the historical stock prices for the past month, and handle the response. This will typically involve some programming knowledge, for instance in Python, using libraries like `requests` or `pandas-datareader`.

3. **Data Parsing and Cleaning:**
   - After you obtain the data, you may need to parse or clean it. This means checking for any inaccuracies or missing values and formatting the data in a way that is useful for your analysis. For instance, you might want to convert the date formats or adjust for any splits or dividends if you're looking at adjusted closing prices.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Analyze the stock price data to observe trends, calculate statistics like the average closing price over the month, or perform other analyses that meet your objectives.
   
5. **Visualization (Optional):**
   - For better understanding and representation, visualize the data using charting tools or libraries (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, or programming libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly in Python).

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps if you choose to use an API and write a script in Python:

**Step 1: Choosing an API**
   - Sign up for an API service like Alpha Vantage and obtain the required API key.

**Step 2: Writing the Script**
   - Install any necessary Python libraries (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
   - Write a Python script that uses the `requests` library to make an API call with the correct endpoint and parameters (symbol for Nvidia, your API key, and the time frame for the data).
   - Parse the JSON or CSV response and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation.

**Step 3: Data Parsing and Cleaning**
   - In your Python script, clean the data if necessary by removing any unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, or converting data types.

**Step 4: Analysis and Visualization**
   - Use Pandas to perform any desired calculations, such as moving averages.
   - Use a library like Matplotlib or Plotly to create charts from the DataFrame, such as line graphs of the closing prices over the past month.

**Note:**
   - It's important to respect the terms of service of the data provider and to be aware of any rate limits on API calls to avoid being blocked.
   - Be aware of stock market holidays and weekends when the market is closed, as these days will not have trading data.

If you encounter any difficulties in any of these sub-tasks, the error will likely fall into one of the following categories: issues with data access or download, errors in the script/code, or data quality issues. In each case, you would need to troubleshoot by checking access permissions, debugging the script, or examining the data for integrity, respectively.

   - Using economic databases, financial news outlets, and market research reports, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted on the factors impacting the industry and Nvidia's market position.

Let's begin by focusing on creating a Python script to get the stock price data. We'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Choose an API to retrieve the data.
2. Write a script using the chosen API and make necessary API calls.
3. Parse the JSON or CSV response and organize it into a useful format.
4. Clean the data if necessary.
5. Perform preliminary analysis and visualize the data.

Please note that accessing an API service like Alpha Vantage might require an API key, which could involve signing up for the service and may be subject to their terms of service, including request limits.

Shall I proceed with writing the Python script to retrieve Nvidia's stock price data over the past month?

Write script using yfinance package instead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To gather historical stock price information for Nvidia (NVDA) for the past month using the `yfinance` package, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Package**: If you haven't already installed `yfinance`, do so by running `pip install yfinance` in your Python environment.

2. **Import the Package**: Import `yfinance` into your script.

3. **Request Stock Data**: Use the `yfinance` package to download the closing price data for Nvidia for the past month.

4. **Plot the Data**: It can be useful to plot the data to visualize the stock's performance over the past month.

Below is the Python script that encompasses these steps:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia
ticker_symbol = 'NVDA'

# Set the date range for the past month: assuming today is 2024-03-18
start_date = '2024-02-18'
end_date = '2024-03-18'

# Download the data from yfinance
nvda_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Select only the 'Close' column for plotting
closing_prices = nvda_data['Close']

# Plot the closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(closing_prices, label='NVDA Closing Prices')
plt.title('NVDA Stock Closing Prices Over the Past Month')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Here, `yfinance` downloads the data from Yahoo Finance for Nvidia between the desired dates (`start_date` and `end_date`). The script then uses `matplotlib` to create a simple line plot of the closing prices over this period.

Would you like me to run this script and generate the plot for you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_proxy (to assistant):

Include code for saving the dataset. Also include code for displaying the table. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To save the dataset of Nvidia's stock prices and display the table along with plotting, you can update the script as follows:

1. **Install Necessary Packages**: You must have `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` installed in your Python environment.
2. **Import Packages**: Import the `yfinance`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `pandas` packages into your script.
3. **Request Stock Data**: Use `yfinance` to download Nvidia's stock price data for the designated period.
4. **Save the Dataset**: Save the downloaded data to a CSV file.
5. **Display the Table**: Use Pandas DataFrame's capabilities to display the table before plotting.
6. **Plot the Data**: Visualize the Nvidia's closing stock prices using `matplotlib`.

Here is the Python script updated with these steps:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia
ticker_symbol = 'NVDA'

# Set the date range for the past month: assuming today is 2024-03-18
start_date = '2024-02-18'
end_date = '2024-03-18'

# Download the data from yfinance
nvda_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Save the data to a CSV file
nvda_data.to_csv('NVDA_stock_data.csv')

# Display the data table
print(nvda_data)

# Select only the 'Close' column for plotting
closing_prices = nvda_data['Close']

# Plot the closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(closing_prices, label='NVDA Closing Prices')
plt.title('NVDA Stock Closing Prices Over the Past Month')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script will download the data, save it as a CSV file named 'NVDA_stock_data.csv', print the data as a table to the console, and plot the closing prices.

Let me know if you want me to run this code or if there are any other modifications you would like to make before execution.

# Nvidia's Stock Price Performance Review: February - March 2024

March 18, 2024

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and finance, keeping a keen eye on industry leaders such as Nvidia Corp (NVDA) provides valuable insights into market trends and investor confidence. Over the past month, Nvidia's stock price has experienced significant movements, prompting investors and analysts to closely monitor the factors driving this volatility. In this blog post, we'll dive into the stock price performance of Nvidia from February 18 to March 18, 2024, and examine the key contributors to its fluctuations.

## A Glimpse Into Nvidia's Stock Price Movement

Analysing the stock performance over the past month reveals a dynamic and eventful period for Nvidia. Starting on February 20, 2024, the stock opened at \$719.47 and experienced a degree of instability, touching a monthly low of \$674.68 on February 21 before surging to a stellar high of \$785.34 on February 22. This upward momentum continued robustly until March 7, peaking at an admirable \$926.69. However, this ascent was followed by a substantial correction, with prices adjusting to \$878.37 by March 15, marking the end of our analysis period.

This turbulent period for Nvidia reflects a broader narrative of rapid adjustments and market reactions to a series of impactful events within the company and across the broader economic and technological ecosystems.

## Unpacking the Influences on Nvidia's Stock Performance

As we sift through the economic news, earnings reports, and industry developments, a pattern of interrelated influences on the semiconductor giant's stock price becomes evident.

Today is 2024-03-18. Write a blogpost about the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

To write a blog post about Nvidia's stock price performance in the past month using Python code, you would need to gather and process the following information:

1. Stock Price Data:
   - Historical daily closing prices of Nvidia stock (NVDA) for the past month.
   - Volume of shares traded each day over the past month.
   - Historical high and low prices for the past month.

2. Company News and Events:
   - Any Nvidia-specific news that might have affected the stock price.
   - Relevant market news or technology sector news.
   - Details of any earnings reports, product launches, partnerships, acquisitions, or other announcements made by Nvidia in the past month.

3. Market Context:
   - Overall stock market performance over the past month, especially comparing tech sector indices such as NASDAQ or S&P 500 Information Technology Sector.
   - Performance of Nvidia's competitors' stocks.
   - Any relevant macroeconomic indicators or events that might have affected the market.

4. Technical Analysis Data (optional for a more in-depth analysis):
   - Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), etc.
   - Candlestick chart patterns for visual analysis and trend identification.

5. Statistical Analysis:
   - Percent change in Nvidia's stock price over the past month.
   - Volatility measures such as standard deviation or average true range.

To retrieve this data using Python, you could use:

- Financial and stock market APIs (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud) to get historical stock price data and technical indicators.
- Python libraries like `requests` for making API calls to news aggregator services for company news and market context.
- Libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- Visualization libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting stock price data and technical indicators if visual representation is desired in the blog post.

Once you've gathered the data, you'd analyze and organize it to tell the story of Nvidia's stock performance in the past month, including any notable ups and downs, and the contextual reasons why these movements may have occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

To create a blog post about the stock performance of Nvidia in the past month, I'll need to leverage financial APIs to retrieve historical stock price data and aggregate any relevant news for analysis. One popular library to achieve this is `yfinance`, which allows Python developers to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Unfortunately, as a language model developed by OpenAI, I can't directly perform web scraping or API calls to retrieve live data. However, I can provide you with a Python script that you can run on your own machine. This script will use `yfinance` to download the historical data for Nvidia (NVDA) and perform some basic analysis on it.

Here's a Python script to retrieve Nvidia's historical stock price data for the past month and calculate some basic performance indicators:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia, and the start and end dates
ticker_symbol = 'NVDA'
start_date = '2023-02-18'
end_date = '2023-03-18'

# Download historical stock price data for Nvidia
data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate percentage change in closing price from the start date to the end date
percentage_change = ((data['Close'].iloc[-1] - data['Close'].iloc[0]) / data['Close'].iloc[0]) * 100

# Calculate the highest and lowest closing price in the past month
highest_price = data['High'].max()
lowest_price = data['Low'].min()

# Output summary statistics
print("Summary for NVDA from", start_date, "to", end_date)
print("Closing price on", start_date, ":", data['Close'].iloc[0])
print("Closing price on", end_date, ":", data['Close'].iloc[-1])
print("Percentage change in the past month:", round(percentage_change, 2), '%')
print("Highest closing price in the past month:", round(highest_price, 2))
print("Lowest closing price in the past month:", round(lowest_price, 2))

# Note: You will need to install the yfinance and pandas packages if you haven't already.
# You can install them using pip:
# pip install yfinance pandas
```

Please note that to run this code, you'll need to have Python installed on your system, along with `yfinance` and `pandas` packages. This script will give you a basic analysis of Nvidia's stock performance over the specified time frame. However, this script does not include any contextual analysis or news aggregation. To create a comprehensive blog post, you would also include analysis and commentary on events that may have influenced the stock's performance.

# Nvidia's Impressive Stock Performance in February-March 2024

In the dynamic world of tech stocks, Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) has recently made headlines with its impressive performance over the past month. Investors and analysts alike have been watching the stock with keen interest, and for good reason. Between February 18 and March 18, 2024, NVDA has shown a considerable surge in value, providing shareholders with significant gains and outperforming many of its peers within the technology sector. Let's dive deeper into the numbers that tell the story of this Silicon Valley giant's latest financial triumph.

## A Month of Gains

Nvidia's stock price saw a notable increase from $206.55 to $257.25—a staggering 24.55% rise within the short span of a month. This remarkable jump is not just a number; it reflects robust investor confidence and market sentiment towards the company's prospects.

### The Highs and Lows

Every stock has its waves of volatility, and Nvidia was no exception. Despite the overall upward trend, the company experienced intraday highs and lows that tested the resilience of its shareholders. The trading period witnessed an all-time monthly high of $263.99, which likely coincided with positive news or earnings reports. The lowest dip was recorded at $204.21, a level that would have presented a lucrative buy opportunity for those bullish on the company's long-term growth.

## What's Driving Nvidia's Surge?

While this post provides a snapshot of Nvidia’s recent financial standing, it's also essential to explore the underlying factors contributing to the stock's performance. Here are a few potential drivers:

- **Innovative Product Releases**: Nvidia's consistent push for innovation, especially in the realms of gaming and AI-driven technology, might have played a key role.

- **Positive Earnings Reports**: High earnings figures can typically fuel investor enthusiasm, leading to a stock price increase.

- **Market Trends**: Given the bigger picture, Nvidia's success could also be reflecting a larger trend in the tech market, perhaps driven by a return of investor confidence in tech stocks post a bearish phase.

- **Strategic Partnerships or Acquisitions**: Any new alliances or acquisitions could have bolstered the company's market standing and expanded its operational reach.

## Final Thoughts

What we've seen with Nvidia is a testament to the fast-paced and rewarding nature of the tech stock market. As the company continues to push the envelope in high-performance computing and gaming, investors may have a lot to look forward to.

Today is 2024-03-18. Write a blogpost about the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

To write a blog post about Nvidia's stock price performance in the past month using Python code, you would need to gather and process the following information:

1. Stock Price Data:
   - Historical daily closing prices of Nvidia stock (NVDA) for the past month.
   - Volume of shares traded each day over the past month.
   - Historical high and low prices for the past month.

2. Company News and Events:
   - Any Nvidia-specific news that might have affected the stock price.
   - Relevant market news or technology sector news.
   - Details of any earnings reports, product launches, partnerships, acquisitions, or other announcements made by Nvidia in the past month.

3. Market Context:
   - Overall stock market performance over the past month, especially comparing tech sector indices such as NASDAQ or S&P 500 Information Technology Sector.
   - Performance of Nvidia's competitors' stocks.
   - Any relevant macroeconomic indicators or events that might have affected the market.

4. Technical Analysis Data (optional for a more in-depth analysis):
   - Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), etc.
   - Candlestick chart patterns for visual analysis and trend identification.

5. Statistical Analysis:
   - Percent change in Nvidia's stock price over the past month.
   - Volatility measures such as standard deviation or average true range.

To retrieve this data using Python, you could use:

- Financial and stock market APIs (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud) to get historical stock price data and technical indicators.
- Python libraries like `requests` for making API calls to news aggregator services for company news and market context.
- Libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- Visualization libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting stock price data and technical indicators if visual representation is desired in the blog post.

Once you've gathered the data, you'd analyze and organize it to tell the story of Nvidia's stock performance in the past month, including any notable ups and downs, and the contextual reasons why these movements may have occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

To create a blog post about the stock performance of Nvidia in the past month, I'll need to leverage financial APIs to retrieve historical stock price data and aggregate any relevant news for analysis. One popular library to achieve this is `yfinance`, which allows Python developers to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Unfortunately, as a language model developed by OpenAI, I can't directly perform web scraping or API calls to retrieve live data. However, I can provide you with a Python script that you can run on your own machine. This script will use `yfinance` to download the historical data for Nvidia (NVDA) and perform some basic analysis on it.

Here's a Python script to retrieve Nvidia's historical stock price data for the past month and calculate some basic performance indicators:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia, and the start and end dates
ticker_symbol = 'NVDA'
start_date = '2023-02-18'
end_date = '2023-03-18'

# Download historical stock price data for Nvidia
data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate percentage change in closing price from the start date to the end date
percentage_change = ((data['Close'].iloc[-1] - data['Close'].iloc[0]) / data['Close'].iloc[0]) * 100

# Calculate the highest and lowest closing price in the past month
highest_price = data['High'].max()
lowest_price = data['Low'].min()

# Output summary statistics
print("Summary for NVDA from", start_date, "to", end_date)
print("Closing price on", start_date, ":", data['Close'].iloc[0])
print("Closing price on", end_date, ":", data['Close'].iloc[-1])
print("Percentage change in the past month:", round(percentage_change, 2), '%')
print("Highest closing price in the past month:", round(highest_price, 2))
print("Lowest closing price in the past month:", round(lowest_price, 2))

# Note: You will need to install the yfinance and pandas packages if you haven't already.
# You can install them using pip:
# pip install yfinance pandas
```

Please note that to run this code, you'll need to have Python installed on your system, along with `yfinance` and `pandas` packages. This script will give you a basic analysis of Nvidia's stock performance over the specified time frame. However, this script does not include any contextual analysis or news aggregation. To create a comprehensive blog post, you would also include analysis and commentary on events that may have influenced the stock's performance.

As an SEO content writer, I need to ensure that the information I provide is accurate and up-to-date. Given the scope of the task, I must mention that the stock prices and percentage changes mentioned in the article are placeholders and should be replaced with current data for publication. To do this, I would

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
python_data_scraper_stock_prices (to chat_manager):

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia
tickerSymbol = 'NVDA'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Define the date range: one month back from today
today = datetime.now()
one_month_ago = today - timedelta(days=30)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker within the specified date range
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start=one_month_ago, end=today)

# Extract closing prices and date information
closing_prices = tickerDf['Close']
dates = closing_prices.index

# Calculate the percentage change over the past month
percentage_change = ((closing_prices[-1] - closing_prices[0]) / closing_prices[0]) * 100

# Find the highest and lowest closing prices over the past month
highest_price = closing_prices.max()
lowest_price = closing_prices.min()

# Present the retrieved data
print(f"Nvidia's Stock Price Performance Over the Past Month")
print(f"Date Range: {dates[0].date()} to {dates[-1].date()}\n")
print(f"Closing Price on {dates[0].date()}: ${closing_prices[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Closing Price on {dates[-1].date()}: ${closing_prices[-1]:.2f}")
print(f"Highest Closing Price: ${highest_price:.2f}")
print(f"Lowest Closing Price: ${lowest_price:.2f}")
print(f"Percentage Change Over the Past Month: {percentage_change:.2f}%\n")
```

Please run this script to get the current data for Nvidia's stock performance over the past month. The output will provide essential figures that can be used to update the placeholders in the previously drafted blog post. Make sure to have `yfinance` installed in your Python environment; you can install it using `pip install yfinance` if it's not already installed.

In this post, we'll scrutinize the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month, exploring the possible reasons behind the fluctuations and analyzing what it might mean for investors.

### A Look at the Figures

As of the close of the market on March 18th, 2024, Nvidia's stock stood at approximately $884.55, which represents a 27.37% change over the last month. Data over the period reveals that the highest point the stock reached was $926.69, while the lowest was $674.69. The stock performance over the month demonstrated both resilience in the face of market uncertainty and susceptibility to broader economic forces.

### Catalysts for Price Movement

Several factors have influenced Nvidia's stock price performance over the past month:

1. **Market Conditions:** The general state of the stock market, driven by macroeconomic indicators, can heavily impact individual stock performances. Interest rate adjustment rumors, inflation data, and strength or weakness in the broader technology sector are all primary contributors to the swings in Nvidia's stock price.

2. **Earnings Reports and Projections:** Given that earnings reports are typically released quarterly and have the potential to greatly affect stock prices, it's possible that a recent Nvidia earnings report or a projection of a future earnings report has played a role in stock price changes over the past month. Strong or weak financial performance, as would be reflected in such reports, could have been a catalyst for investor reaction.

3. **Product Releases and Developments:** Nvidia is at the forefront of GPU technology and any announcements related to new products, updates to existing product lines, or advancements in research and development can have a significant impact on the investor outlook and, by extension, on the stock price.

4. **Industry Competition and Market Share:** Nvidia's position compared to its competitors is also a key factor in its stock performance. Any fluctuations in market share or competitive edge could affect investor confidence and stock valuation.

5. **Regulatory Changes and Global Events:** Regulatory changes in key markets or global events that impact the technology sector, trade relations, or supply chains can lead to shifts in stock prices as investors reassess their risk and potential returns.

### Technical and Fundamental Analysis

Technical analysts, who study statistical trends from trading activity, might have identified particular patterns in Nvidia's stock movements suggesting the recent momentum. Trends such as support and resistance levels and other indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) provide insights that could potentially inform investors about the stock’s short-term movements.

Meanwhile, fundamental analysis reveals the company's intrinsic value by looking at financial statements, market position, and growth prospects. Nvidia's innovation in technology and the strategic positioning of their products and services are aspects that are evaluated to make long-term investment decisions.

### Forward-Looking Statements

Despite the challenges of accurately predicting the stock market, Nvidia's recent performance indicates investor confidence in the company's growth potential and resilience. However, as is always the case with stock investments, past performance is not indicative of future results, and external factors can have unpredictable impacts on stock prices.

Investing in technology stocks like Nvidia often requires a keen eye on both company-specific news and broader economic indicators. Diversification remains a recommended strategy to mitigate potential risks associated with market volatility.

### Conclusion

The past month's impressive rally in Nvidia's stock price underscores the company's strong performance and the market's optimistic assessment of its future outlook. However, investors must remain vigilant and informed as they navigate the ever-changing landscape of the technology sector. With careful analysis and consideration of both external factors and internal company developments, investors can make more informed decisions on whether to buy, hold, or sell Nvidia stock.

Please note: This blog post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Investors should always conduct their own research or seek professional advice before making investment decisions.

With the current figures now in hand, I have replaced the placeholders with accurate and updated data. The contextual analysis and underlying factors contributing to Nvidia's stock performance are also discussed, providing readers a comprehensive overview.

Nvidia's stock price has seen a 27.37% increase over the past month with a closing price of $884.55 on March 18th, 2024. The stock fluctuated, reaching a high of $926.69 and a low of $674.69 during this time. Factors influencing the stock's performance include overall market conditions, earnings reports, product releases and developments, competition, and regulatory changes. Both technical and fundamental analyses are used to understand stock movements and make investment decisions, but investing in technology stocks carries risks and requires staying informed about industry and economic trends. Past performance does not necessarily predict future results, and investors are advised to research and seek professional advice before making investment decisions.

## Approach 4: Customize a task scheduler

A more general approach is to customize a task scheduler agent. Given a
task, the agent decomposes the task into sub-tasks and assign them to
agents with different expertise.

***** Response from calling tool "call_NjFZnleIFlJFTHcBeHPVJyXx" *****
As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time data access or the ability to fetch live stock prices. However, you can obtain Nvidia's stock price performance by using financial data APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or others that provide stock price data.

To analyze Nvidia’s stock price performance over the past month, you can use the `yfinance` library in Python, which allows you to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. Make sure you install the `yfinance` package before running the code if it's not already installed in your environment.

Below is the Python code block that fetches Nvidia's stock price data for the past month and performs a basic analysis of the price performance:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Fetch Nvidia's stock data for the past month
nvidia_stock = yf.Ticker("NVDA")
nvidia_df = nvidia_stock.history(period="1mo")

# Calculate some basic metrics
last_price = nvidia_df['Close'].iloc[-1]
price_change = nvidia_df['Close'] - nvidia_df['Close'].shift(1)
percent_change = price_change / nvidia_df['Close'].shift(1) * 100
average_change = percent_change.mean()
max_price = nvidia_df['Close'].max()
min_price = nvidia_df['Close'].min()

print(f"Nvidia's Stock Performance Over the Past Month:\n")
print(f"Last Close Price: {last_price:.2f}")
print(f"Average Daily Percentage Change: {average_change:.2f}%")
print(f"Maximum Price: {max_price:.2f}")
print(f"Minimum Price: {min_price:.2f}")
```

The output of the print statements will give you Nvidia’s last close price, the average daily percentage change, and the maximum and minimum stock prices over the past month. Note that if you're looking for a more detailed analysis (e.g., predictive modeling, complex pattern recognition), you would need to apply more advanced financial analysis techniques and might also consider external factors impacting stock prices.
This is the output of the code blocks when executed:
/Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages/yfinance/utils.py:775: FutureWarning: The 'unit' keyword in TimedeltaIndex construction is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use pd.to_timedelta instead.
  df.index += _pd.TimedeltaIndex(dst_error_hours, 'h')
Nvidia's Stock Performance Over the Past Month:

Last Close Price: 884.55
Average Daily Percentage Change: 1.38%
Maximum Price: 926.69
Minimum Price: 674.69
