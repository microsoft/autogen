### Biography of the speakers:

Andy Zhou is currently a BS/MS student at UIUC advised by Bo Li. His research focuses on improving the decision-making abilities and addressing the security vulnerabilities of large language models. He has published papers in trustworthy machine learning, AI safety, and language model agents in multiple top AI conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML. For details, see https://www.andyzhou.ai

Kai Yan is currently a third-year PhD student at UIUC, co-advised by Yuxiong Wang and Alexander Schwing. He received a BS in computer science from Peking University in 2021. His research interest is to build more versatile and efficient decision-making agents with demonstration-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL) and large language models. He has published papers on RL, Imitation Learning (IL), Large Language Model (LLM) agents, and optimization in multiple top AI conferences, and has served as a reviewer for top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, etc. For details, see https://kaiyan289.github.io/.

### Abstract:

Recent years have witnessed great development of AI agents. However, traditional AI, such as vanilla tree search and RL, has several limitations: inability of high-level understanding of the environment, low generalizability, and low learning efficiency. Fortunately, the advent of foundation models has enabled us to build agents that overcome all those shortcomings. With foundation models, AI agents have the potential to possess (super-)human-level reasoning, acting, and planning abilities, which are the most important features for future AI agents. In this talk, we introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), the first framework that realizes all three capabilities of LLMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. Our work enables LLMs as agents to leverage tree-based search algorithms while employing LLM-powered value functions and self-reflections for cleverer exploration, which provides a more adaptive problem-solving mechanism. We show that our method is 1) empirically successful on a variety of tasks across different domains including tool-use, coding, and web agents, 2) more efficient than prior tree-search-based works, and 3) importantly, conveniently adaptable for Autogen users.
