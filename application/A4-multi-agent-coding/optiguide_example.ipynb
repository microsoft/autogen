        "- Collaborative Problem Solving: The collaboration among the user proxy agent and the assistant agents fosters a cooperative problem-solving environment. The agents can share information and knowledge, allowing them to complement each other's abilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. On the other hand, the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker, which can perform another safety check pass on the generated code.\n",

        "- Modularity: The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall development process and facilitating code management.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Management: The OptiGuide agent's role in maintaining memory related to user interactions is crucial. The memory retention allows the agents to have context about a user's prior questions, making the decision-making process more informed and context-aware.\n",
