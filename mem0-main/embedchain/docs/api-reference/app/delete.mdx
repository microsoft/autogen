## Delete Document

`delete()` method allows you to delete a document previously added to the app.

### Usage

```python
from embedchain import App

app = App()

forbes_doc_id = app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")
wiki_doc_id = app.add("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk")

app.delete(forbes_doc_id)   # deletes the forbes document
```

<Note>
    If you do not have the document id, you can use `app.db.get()` method to get the document and extract the `hash` key from `metadatas` dictionary object, which serves as the document id.
</Note>


## Delete Chat Session History

`delete_session_chat_history()` method allows you to delete all previous messages in a chat history.

### Usage

```python
from embedchain import App

app = App()

app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

app.chat("What is the net worth of Elon Musk?")

app.delete_session_chat_history()
```

<Note>
    `delete_session_chat_history(session_id="session_1")` method also accepts `session_id` optional param for deleting chat history of a specific session.
    It assumes the default session if no `session_id` is provided.
