title: 'ðŸ’» Full stack'
---

Get started with full-stack RAG applications using Embedchain's easy-to-use CLI tool. Set up everything with just a few commands, whether you prefer Docker or not.

## Prerequisites

Choose your setup method:

* [Without docker](#without-docker)
* [With Docker](#with-docker)

### Without Docker

Ensure these are installed:

- Embedchain python package (`pip install embedchain`)
- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### With Docker

Install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Quick Start Guide

### Install the package

Before proceeding, make sure you have the Embedchain package installed.

```bash
pip install embedchain -U
```

### Setting Up

For the purpose of the demo, you have to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to start with but you can choose any llm by changing the configuration easily.

### Installation Commands

<CodeGroup>

```bash without docker
ec create-app my-app
cd my-app
ec start
```

```bash with docker
ec create-app my-app --docker
cd my-app
ec start --docker
```

</CodeGroup>

### What Happens Next?

1. Embedchain fetches a full stack template (FastAPI backend, Next.JS frontend).
2. Installs required components.
3. Launches both frontend and backend servers.

### See It In Action

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the chat UI.

You can customize the UI and code as per your requirements.
