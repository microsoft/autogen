title: 'üîç Semantic Search'
---

Semantic searching, which involves understanding the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries, is yet another popular use-case of RAG. It has several popular use cases across various domains:

- **Information Retrieval**: Enhances search accuracy in databases and websites
- **E-commerce**: Improves product discovery in online shopping
- **Customer Support**: Powers smarter chatbots for effective responses
- **Content Discovery**: Aids in finding relevant media content
- **Knowledge Management**: Streamlines document and data retrieval in enterprises
- **Healthcare**: Facilitates medical research and literature search
- **Legal Research**: Assists in legal document and case law search
- **Academic Research**: Aids in academic paper discovery
- **Language Processing**: Enables multilingual search capabilities

Embedchain offers a simple yet customizable `search()` API that you can use for semantic search. See the example in the next section to know more.

## Example: Semantic Search over Next.JS Website + Forum

### Step 1: Set Up Your RAG Pipeline

First, let's create your RAG pipeline. Open your Python environment and enter:

```python Create pipeline
from embedchain import App
app = App()
```

This initializes your application.

### Step 2: Populate Your Pipeline with Data

Now, let's add data to your pipeline. We'll include the Next.JS website and its documentation:

```python Ingest data sources
# Add Next.JS Website and docs
app.add("https://nextjs.org/sitemap.xml", data_type="sitemap")

# Add Next.JS Forum data
app.add("https://nextjs-forum.com/sitemap.xml", data_type="sitemap")
```

This step incorporates over **15K pages** from the Next.JS website and forum into your pipeline. For more data source options, check the [Embedchain data sources overview](/components/data-sources/overview).

### Step 3: Local Testing of Your Pipeline

Test the pipeline on your local machine:

```python Search App
app.search("Summarize the features of Next.js 14?")

```
The `source` key contains the url of the document that yielded that document chunk.

If you are interested in configuring the search further, refer to our [API documentation](/api-reference/pipeline/search).

### (Optional) Step 4: Deploying Your RAG Pipeline

Want to go live? Deploy your pipeline with these options:

- Deploy on the Embedchain Platform
- Self-host on your preferred cloud provider

For detailed deployment instructions, follow these guides:

- [Deploying on Embedchain Platform](/get-started/deployment#deploy-on-embedchain-platform)
- [Self-hosting Guide](/get-started/deployment#self-hosting)
