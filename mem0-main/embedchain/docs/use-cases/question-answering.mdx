## Example: Build a Q&A System with Embedchain for Next.JS

Quickly create a RAG pipeline to answer queries about the [Next.JS Framework](https://nextjs.org/) using Embedchain tools.

### Step 1: Set Up Your RAG Pipeline

First, let's create your RAG pipeline. Open your Python environment and enter:

```python Create pipeline
from embedchain import App
app = App()
```

This initializes your application.

### Step 2: Populate Your Pipeline with Data

Now, let's add data to your pipeline. We'll include the Next.JS website and its documentation:

```python Ingest data sources
# Add Next.JS Website and docs
app.add("https://nextjs.org/sitemap.xml", data_type="sitemap")

# Add Next.JS Forum data
app.add("https://nextjs-forum.com/sitemap.xml", data_type="sitemap")
```

This step incorporates over **15K pages** from the Next.JS website and forum into your pipeline. For more data source options, check the [Embedchain data sources overview](/components/data-sources/overview).

### Step 3: Local Testing of Your Pipeline

Test the pipeline on your local machine:

```python Query App
app.query("Summarize the features of Next.js 14?")
```

Run this query to see how your pipeline responds with information about Next.js 14.

### (Optional) Step 4: Deploying Your RAG Pipeline

Want to go live? Deploy your pipeline with these options:

- Deploy on the Embedchain Platform
- Self-host on your preferred cloud provider

For detailed deployment instructions, follow these guides:
