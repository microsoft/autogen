title: Amazon S3 Vectors
---

[Amazon S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) is a purpose-built, cost-optimized vector storage and query service for semantic search and AI applications. It provides S3-level elasticity and durability with sub-second query performance.

### Installation

S3 Vectors support requires additional dependencies. Install them with:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Usage

To use Amazon S3 Vectors with Mem0, you need to have an AWS account and the necessary IAM permissions (`s3vectors:*`). Ensure your environment is configured with AWS credentials (e.g., via `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables).

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

# Ensure your AWS credentials are configured in your environment
# e.g., by setting AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "s3_vectors",
        "config": {
            "vector_bucket_name": "my-mem0-vector-bucket",
            "index_name": "my-memories-index",
            "embedding_model_dims": 1536,
            "distance_metric": "cosine",
            "region_name": "us-east-1"
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movie? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config

Here are the available parameters for the `s3_vectors` config:

| Parameter              | Description                                                          | Default Value |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `vector_bucket_name`   | The name of the S3 Vector bucket to use. It will be created if it doesn't exist. | Required      |
| `index_name`           | The name of the vector index within the bucket.                        | `mem0`        |
| `embedding_model_dims` | Dimensions of the embedding model. Must match your embedder.         | `1536`        |
| `distance_metric`      | Distance metric for similarity search. Options: `cosine`, `euclidean`. | `cosine`      |
| `region_name`          | The AWS region where the bucket and index reside.                    | `None` (uses default from AWS config) |

### IAM Permissions

Your AWS identity (user or role) needs permissions to perform actions on S3 Vectors. A minimal policy would look like this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3vectors:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

For production, it is recommended to scope down the resource ARN to your specific buckets and indexes.
