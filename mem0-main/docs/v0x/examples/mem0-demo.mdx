You can try the [Mem0 Demo](https://mem0-4vmi.vercel.app) live here.

## Overview

The Personalized AI Companion leverages Mem0 to retain information across interactions, enabling a tailored learning experience. It creates memories for each user interaction and integrates with OpenAI's GPT models to provide detailed and context-aware responses to user queries.

## Setup

Before you begin, follow these steps to set up the demo application:

1. Clone the Mem0 repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the demo application folder:
   ```bash
   cd mem0/examples/mem0-demo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   MEM0_API_KEY=your_mem0_api_key
   ```
   You can obtain your `MEM0_API_KEY` by signing up at [Mem0 API Dashboard](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys).

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Enhancing the Next.js Application

Once the demo is running, you can customize and enhance the Next.js application by modifying the components in the `mem0-demo` folder. Consider:
- Adding new memory features to improve contextual retention.
- Customizing the UI to better suit your application needs.
- Integrating additional APIs or third-party services to extend functionality.

## Conclusion

This setup demonstrates how to build an AI Companion that maintains memory across interactions using Mem0. The system continuously adapts to user interactions, making future responses more relevant and personalized. Experiment with the application and enhance it further to suit your use case!
