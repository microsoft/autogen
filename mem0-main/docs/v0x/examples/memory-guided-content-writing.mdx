title: Memory-Guided Content Writing
---

This guide demonstrates how to leverage **Mem0** to streamline content writing by applying your unique writing style and preferences using persistent memory.

## Why Use Mem0?

Integrating Mem0 into your writing workflow helps you:

1. **Store persistent writing preferences** ensuring consistent tone, formatting, and structure.
2. **Automate content refinement** by retrieving preferences when rewriting or reviewing content.
3. **Scale your writing style** so it applies consistently across multiple documents or sessions.

## Setup

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from mem0 import MemoryClient

os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "your-mem0-api-key"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"


# Set up Mem0 and OpenAI client
client = MemoryClient()
openai = OpenAI()

USER_ID = "content_writer"
RUN_ID = "smart_editing_session"
```

## **Storing Your Writing Preferences in Mem0**

```python
def store_writing_preferences():
    """Store your writing preferences in Mem0."""
    
    preferences = """My writing preferences:
1. Use headings and sub-headings for structure.
2. Keep paragraphs concise (8–10 sentences max).
3. Incorporate specific numbers and statistics.
4. Provide concrete examples.
5. Use bullet points for clarity.
6. Avoid jargon and buzzwords."""

    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Here are my writing style preferences."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": preferences}
    ]

    response = client.add(
        messages,
        user_id=USER_ID,
        run_id=RUN_ID,
        metadata={"type": "preferences", "category": "writing_style"}
    )

    return response
```

## **Editing Content Using Stored Preferences**

```python
def apply_writing_style(original_content):
    """Use preferences stored in Mem0 to guide content rewriting."""

    results = client.search(
        query="What are my writing style preferences?",
        version="v2",
        filters={
            "AND": [
                {
                    "user_id": USER_ID
                },
                {
                    "run_id": RUN_ID
                }
            ]
        },
    )

    if not results:
        print("No preferences found.")
        return None

    preferences = "\n".join(r["memory"] for r in results.get('results', []))

    system_prompt = f"""
You are a writing assistant.

Apply the following writing style preferences to improve the user's content:

Preferences:
{preferences}
"""

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"""Original Content:
    {original_content}"""}
    ]

    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=messages
    )
    clean_response = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

    return clean_response
```

## **Complete Workflow: Content Editing**

```python
def content_writing_workflow(content):
    """Automated workflow for editing a document based on writing preferences."""
    
    # Store writing preferences (if not already stored)
    store_writing_preferences()  # Ideally done once, or with a conditional check
    
    # Edit the document with Mem0 preferences
    edited_content = apply_writing_style(content)
    
    if not edited_content:
        return "Failed to edit document."
    
    # Display results
    print("\n=== ORIGINAL DOCUMENT ===\n")
    print(content)
    
    print("\n=== EDITED DOCUMENT ===\n")
    print(edited_content)
    
    return edited_content
```

## **Example Usage**

```python
# Define your document
original_content = """Project Proposal
