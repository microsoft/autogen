You can create a personalised Eliza OS Character using Mem0. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps and provide the complete code to get you started.

## Overview

ElizaOS is a powerful AI agent framework for autonomy & personality. It is a collection of tools that help you create a personalised AI agent.

## Setup
You can start by cloning the eliza-os repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza.git
```

Change the directory to the eliza-os repository:

```bash
cd eliza
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Setup ENVs

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following ( You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference):

```bash
# Mem0 Configuration
MEM0_API_KEY= # Mem0 API Key ( Get from https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys )
MEM0_USER_ID= # Default: eliza-os-user
MEM0_PROVIDER= # Default: openai
MEM0_PROVIDER_API_KEY= # API Key for the provider (openai, anthropic, etc.)
SMALL_MEM0_MODEL= # Default: gpt-4o-mini
MEDIUM_MEM0_MODEL= # Default: gpt-4o
LARGE_MEM0_MODEL= # Default: gpt-4o
```

## Make the default character use Mem0

By default, there is a character called `eliza` that uses the `ollama` model. You can make this character use Mem0 by changing the config in the `agent/src/defaultCharacter.ts` file.

```ts
modelProvider: ModelProviderName.MEM0,
```

This will make the character use Mem0 to generate responses.

## Run the project

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Conclusion

You have now created a personalised Eliza OS Character using Mem0. You can now start interacting with the character by running the project and talking to the character.

This is a simple example of how to use Mem0 to create a personalised AI agent. You can use this as a starting point to create your own AI agent.
