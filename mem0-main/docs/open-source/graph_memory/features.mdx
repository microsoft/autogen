Graph Memory is a powerful feature that allows users to create and utilize complex relationships between pieces of information.

## Graph Memory supports the following features:

### Using Custom Prompts

Users can specify a custom prompt that will be used to extract specific entities from the given input text.
This allows for more targeted and relevant information extraction based on the user's needs.
Here's an example of how to specify a custom prompt:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from mem0 import Memory

    config = {
        "graph_store": {
            "provider": "neo4j",
            "config": {
                "url": "neo4j+s://xxx",
                "username": "neo4j",
                "password": "xxx"
            },
            "custom_prompt": "Please only extract entities containing sports related relationships and nothing else.",
        }
    }

    m = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Memory } from "mem0ai/oss";

    const config = {
        graphStore: {
            provider: "neo4j",
            config: {
                url: "neo4j+s://xxx",
                username: "neo4j",
                password: "xxx",
            },
            customPrompt: "Please only extract entities containing sports related relationships and nothing else.",
        }
    }

    const memory = new Memory(config);
    ```
