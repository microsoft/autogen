## Welcome to Mem0 Open Source

Mem0 is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications that enables personalized AI experiences while saving costs and delighting users. The open-source version gives you complete control over your memory infrastructure.

## Why Choose Mem0 Open Source?

Mem0 open-source provides a powerful, flexible foundation for AI memory management with these key advantages:

1. **Complete Control**: Deploy and manage your own memory infrastructure with full customization capabilities. Perfect for organizations that need data sovereignty and custom integrations.

2. **Flexible Architecture**: Choose from multiple vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma, PGVector), graph stores (Neo4j, Memgraph), and embedding models to fit your specific needs.

3. **Advanced Memory Organization**: Organize memories using `user_id`, `agent_id`, and `run_id` parameters for sophisticated multi-agent, multi-session applications with precise context control.

4. **Rich Integration Ecosystem**: Seamlessly integrate with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Vercel AI SDK.

## Core Features

### Memory Management
- **Synchronous & Asynchronous Operations**: Choose between sync and async memory operations based on your application needs
- **Smart Memory Retrieval**: Intelligent search and retrieval with semantic understanding
- **Memory Persistence**: Long-term storage with automatic optimization and cleanup

### Advanced Organization
- **User Context**: Organize memories by user for personalized experiences
- **Agent Isolation**: Separate memories by AI agent for specialized knowledge domains
- **Session Tracking**: Use run IDs to maintain context across different conversation sessions

### Flexible Storage
- **Vector Databases**: Support for Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma, and PGVector
- **Graph Stores**: Neo4j and Memgraph integration for relationship-based memory
- **Embedding Models**: Multiple embedding providers for optimal performance
