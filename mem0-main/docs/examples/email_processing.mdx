title: Email Processing with Mem0
---

This guide demonstrates how to build an intelligent email processing system using Mem0's memory capabilities. You'll learn how to store, categorize, retrieve, and analyze emails to create a smart email management solution.

## Overview

Email overload is a common challenge for many professionals. By leveraging Mem0's memory capabilities, you can build an intelligent system that:

- Stores emails as searchable memories
- Categorizes emails automatically
- Retrieves relevant past conversations
- Prioritizes messages based on importance
- Generates summaries and action items

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install mem0ai openai
```

## Implementation

### Basic Email Memory System

The following example shows how to create a basic email processing system with Mem0:

```python
import os
from mem0 import MemoryClient
from email.parser import Parser

# Configure API keys
os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "your-mem0-api-key"

# Initialize Mem0 client
client = MemoryClient()

class EmailProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the Email Processor with Mem0 memory client"""
        self.client = client
        
    def process_email(self, email_content, user_id):
        """
        Process an email and store it in Mem0 memory
        
        Args:
            email_content (str): Raw email content
            user_id (str): User identifier for memory association
        """
        # Parse email
        parser = Parser()
        email = parser.parsestr(email_content)
        
        # Extract email details
        sender = email['from']
        recipient = email['to']
        subject = email['subject']
        date = email['date']
        body = self._get_email_body(email)
        
        # Create message object for Mem0
        message = {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Email from {sender}: {subject}\n\n{body}"
        }
        
        # Create metadata for better retrieval
        metadata = {
            "email_type": "incoming",
            "sender": sender,
            "recipient": recipient,

            "date": date
        }
        
        # Store in Mem0 with appropriate categories
        response = self.client.add(
            messages=[message],
            user_id=user_id,
            metadata=metadata,
            categories=["email", "correspondence"],
            version="v2"

        return response
    
    def _get_email_body(self, email):
        """Extract the body content from an email"""
        # Simplified extraction - in real-world, handle multipart emails
        if email.is_multipart():
            for part in email.walk():
                if part.get_content_type() == "text/plain":
                    return part.get_payload(decode=True).decode()
        else:
            return email.get_payload(decode=True).decode()
    
    def search_emails(self, query, user_id):
        """
        Search through stored emails

Hi Bob,

I wanted to update you on the schedule for our upcoming project meeting.
We'll be meeting this Thursday at 2pm instead of Friday.

Could you please prepare your section of the presentation?

Thanks,
Alice
"""

# Process and store the email
user_id = "bob@example.com"
processor.process_email(sample_email, user_id)

# Later, search for emails about meetings
meeting_emails = processor.search_emails("meeting schedule", user_id)
print(f"Found {len(meeting_emails['results'])} relevant emails")

- **Action Item Extraction**: Identify and track tasks mentioned in emails
- **Priority Management**: Focus on important emails based on AI-determined priority
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain thread context for more relevant interactions

## Conclusion

By combining Mem0's memory capabilities with email processing, you can create intelligent email management systems that help users organize, prioritize, and act on their inbox effectively. The advanced capabilities like automatic categorization, action item extraction, and priority management can significantly reduce the time spent on email management, allowing users to focus on more important tasks.
