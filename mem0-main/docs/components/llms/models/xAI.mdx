[xAI](https://x.ai/) is a new AI company founded by Elon Musk that develops large language models, including Grok. Grok is trained on real-time data from X (formerly Twitter) and aims to provide accurate, up-to-date responses with a touch of wit and humor.

In order to use LLMs from xAI, go to their [platform](https://console.x.ai) and get the API key. Set the API key as `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable to use the model as given below in the example.

## Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key" # used for embedding model
os.environ["XAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "xai",
        "config": {
            "model": "grok-3-beta",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "max_tokens": 2000,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Iâ€™m not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```
