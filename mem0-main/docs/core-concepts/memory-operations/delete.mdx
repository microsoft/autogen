## Overview

Memories can become outdated, irrelevant, or need to be removed for privacy or compliance reasons. Mem0 offers flexible ways to delete memory:

1. **Delete a Single Memory**: Using a specific memory ID
2. **Batch Delete**: Delete multiple known memory IDs (up to 1000)
3. **Filtered Delete**: Delete memories matching a filter (e.g., `user_id`, `metadata`, `run_id`)

This page walks through code example for each method.


## Use Cases

- Forget a user’s past preferences by request
- Remove outdated or incorrect memory entries
- Clean up memory after session expiration
- Comply with data deletion requests (e.g., GDPR)

## 1. Delete a Single Memory by ID

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

memory_id = "your_memory_id"
client.delete(memory_id=memory_id)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

client.delete("your_memory_id")
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## 2. Batch Delete Multiple Memories

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

delete_memories = [
    {"memory_id": "id1"},
    {"memory_id": "id2"}
]

response = client.batch_delete(delete_memories)
print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

const deleteMemories = [
  { memory_id: "id1" },
  { memory_id: "id2" }
];

client.batchDelete(deleteMemories)
  .then(response => console.log('Batch delete response:', response))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## 3. Delete Memories by Filter (e.g., user_id)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Delete all memories for a specific user
client.delete_all(user_id="alice")
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

client.deleteAll({ user_id: "alice" })
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also filter by other parameters such as:
- `agent_id`
- `run_id`
- `metadata` (as JSON string)

## Key Differences

| Method                | Use When                                | IDs Needed | Filters |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|----------|
| `delete(memory_id)`  | You know exactly which memory to remove   | ✔          | ✘        |
| `batch_delete([...])`| You have a known list of memory IDs       | ✔          | ✘        |
| `delete_all(...)`    | You want to delete by user/agent/run/etc | ✘          | ✔        |
