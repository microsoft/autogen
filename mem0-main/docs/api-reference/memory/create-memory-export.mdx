Submit a job to create a structured export of memories using a customizable Pydantic schema. This process may take some time to complete, especially if youâ€™re exporting a large number of memories. You can tailor the export by applying various filters (e.g., user_id, agent_id, run_id, or session_id) and by modifying the Pydantic schema to ensure the final data matches your exact needs.
