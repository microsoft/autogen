## Overview

The Memory Timestamps feature allows you to specify when a memory was created, regardless of when it's actually added to the system. This powerful capability enables you to:

- Maintain accurate chronological ordering of memories
- Import historical data with proper timestamps
- Create memories that reflect when events actually occurred
- Build timelines with precise temporal information

By leveraging custom timestamps, you can ensure that your memory system maintains an accurate representation of when information was generated or events occurred.

## Benefits of Custom Timestamps

Custom timestamps offer several important benefits:

• **Historical Accuracy**: Preserve the exact timing of past events and information.

• **Data Migration**: Seamlessly migrate existing data while maintaining original timestamps.

• **Time-Sensitive Analysis**: Enable time-based analysis and pattern recognition across memories.

• **Consistent Chronology**: Maintain proper ordering of memories for coherent storytelling.

## Using Custom Timestamps

When adding new memories, you can specify a custom timestamp to indicate when the memory was created. This timestamp will be used instead of the current time.

### Adding Memories with Custom Timestamps

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from mem0 import MemoryClient

os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

client = MemoryClient()

# Get the current time
current_time = datetime.now()

# Calculate 5 days ago
five_days_ago = current_time - timedelta(days=5)

# Convert to Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
unix_timestamp = int(five_days_ago.timestamp())

# Add memory with custom timestamp
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="user1", timestamp=unix_timestamp)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';
const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Get the current time
const currentTime = new Date();

// Calculate 5 days ago
const fiveDaysAgo = new Date();
fiveDaysAgo.setDate(currentTime.getDate() - 5);

// Convert to Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
const unixTimestamp = Math.floor(fiveDaysAgo.getTime() / 1000);

// Add memory with custom timestamp
const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"}
]
client.add(messages, { user_id: "user1", timestamp: unixTimestamp })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"}],
         "user_id": "user1",
         "timestamp": 1721577600
     }'
```

```json Output
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4g7h-8i9j-k0l1m2n3o4p5",
            "data": {"memory": "Travelling to SF"},
            "event": "ADD"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Timestamp Format

When specifying a custom timestamp, you should provide a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). This is an integer representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (UTC).

For example, to create a memory with a timestamp of January 1, 2023:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# January 1, 2023 timestamp
january_2023_timestamp = 1672531200  # Unix timestamp for 2023-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="user1", timestamp=january_2023_timestamp)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// January 1, 2023 timestamp
const january2023Timestamp = 1672531200;  // Unix timestamp for 2023-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"}
]
client.add(messages, { user_id: "user1", timestamp: january2023Timestamp })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
