## How to use Direct Import?
The Direct Import feature allows users to skip the memory deduction phase and directly input pre-defined memories into the system for storage and retrieval.
To enable this feature, you need to set the `infer` parameter to `False` in the `add` method.


<CodeGroup>


```python Python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Alice loves playing badminton"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's great! Alice is a fitness freak"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Alice mostly cook at home because of gym plan"},
]


client.add(messages, user_id="alice", infer=False)
```

```markdown Output
[]
```
</CodeGroup>

You can see that the output of add call is an empty list.

<Note> Only messages with the role "user" will be used for storage. Messages with roles such as "assistant" or "system" will be ignored during the storage process. </Note>


## How to retrieve memories?

You can retrieve memories using the `search` method.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.search("What is Alice's favorite sport?", user_id="alice", output_format="v1.1")
```

```json Output
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "19d6d7aa-2454-4e58-96fc-e74d9e9f8dd1",
      "memory": "Alice loves playing badminton",
      "user_id": "pc123",
      "metadata": null,
      "categories": null,
      "created_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474901-07:00",
      "updated_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474912-07:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## How to retrieve all memories?

You can retrieve all memories using the `get_all` method.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.get_all(query="What is Alice's favorite sport?", user_id="alice", output_format="v1.1")
```

```json Output
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "19d6d7aa-2454-4e58-96fc-e74d9e9f8dd1",
      "memory": "Alice loves playing badminton",
      "user_id": "pc123",
      "metadata": null,
      "categories": null,
      "created_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474901-07:00",
      "updated_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474912-07:00"
    },
    {
      "id": "8557f05d-7b3c-47e5-b409-9886f9e314fc",
      "memory": "Alice mostly cook at home because of gym plan",
      "user_id": "pc123",
      "metadata": null,
      "categories": null,
      "created_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474929-07:00",
      "updated_at": "2024-10-15T21:52:11.474932-07:00"
    }
  ]
}
