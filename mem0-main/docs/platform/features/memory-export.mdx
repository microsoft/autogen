## Overview

The Memory Export feature allows you to create structured exports of memories using customizable Pydantic schemas. This process enables you to transform your stored memories into specific data formats that match your needs. You can apply various filters to narrow down which memories to export and define exactly how the data should be structured.

## Creating a Memory Export

To create a memory export, you'll need to:
1. Define your schema structure
2. Submit an export job
3. Retrieve the exported data

### Define Schema

Here's an example schema for extracting professional profile information:

```json
{
    "$defs": {
        "EducationLevel": {
            "enum": ["high_school", "bachelors", "masters"],
            "title": "EducationLevel",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "EmploymentStatus": {
            "enum": ["full_time", "part_time", "student"],
            "title": "EmploymentStatus", 
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "properties": {
        "full_name": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "maxLength": 100,
                    "minLength": 2,
                    "type": "string"
                },
                {
                    "type": "null"
                }
            ],
            "default": null,
            "description": "The professional's full name",
            "title": "Full Name"
        },
        "current_role": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                {
                    "type": "null"
                }
            ],
            "default": null,
            "description": "Current job title or role",
            "title": "Current Role"
        }
    },
    "title": "ProfessionalProfile",
    "type": "object"
}
```

### Submit Export Job

You can optionally provide additional instructions to guide how memories are processed and structured during export using the `export_instructions` parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Basic export request
response = client.create_memory_export(
    schema=json_schema,
    user_id="alice"
)

# Export with custom instructions
export_instructions = """
1. Create a comprehensive profile with detailed information in each category
2. Only mark fields as "None" when absolutely no relevant information exists
3. Base all information directly on the user's memories
4. When contradictions exist, prioritize the most recent information
5. Clearly distinguish between factual statements and inferences
"""

# For create operation, using only user_id filter as requested
filters = {
    "AND": [
        {"user_id": "alex"}
    ]
}

response = client.create_memory_export(
    schema=json_schema,
    filters=filters,
    export_instructions=export_instructions  # Optional
)

print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Basic Export request
const response = await client.createMemoryExport({
    schema: json_schema,
    user_id: "alice"
});

// Export with custom instructions
const export_instructions = `
1. Create a comprehensive profile with detailed information in each category
2. Only mark fields as "None" when absolutely no relevant information exists
3. Base all information directly on the user's memories
4. When contradictions exist, prioritize the most recent information
5. Clearly distinguish between factual statements and inferences
`;

// For create operation, using only user_id filter as requested
const filters = {
    "AND": [
        {"user_id": "alex"}
    ]
}

const responseWithInstructions = await client.createMemoryExport({
    schema: json_schema,
    filters: filters,
    export_instructions: export_instructions
});

console.log(responseWithInstructions);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/export/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "schema": {json_schema},
         "user_id": "alice",
         "export_instructions": "1. Create a comprehensive profile with detailed information\n2. Only mark fields as \"None\" when absolutely no relevant information exists"
     }'
```

```json Output
{
    "message": "Memory export request received. The export will be ready in a few seconds.",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Retrieve Export

Once the export job is complete, you can retrieve the structured data in two ways:

#### Using Export ID

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Retrieve using export ID
response = client.get_memory_export(memory_export_id="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Retrieve using export ID
const memory_export_id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000";

const response = await client.getMemoryExport({
    memory_export_id: memory_export_id
});

console.log(response);
```

```json Output
{
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "current_role": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "years_experience": 8,
    "employment_status": "full_time",
    "education_level": "masters",
    "skills": ["Python", "AWS", "Machine Learning"]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Using Filters

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Retrieve using filters
filters = {
    "AND": [
        {"created_at": {"gte": "2024-07-10", "lte": "2024-07-20"}},
        {"user_id": "alex"}
    ]
}

response = client.get_memory_export(filters=filters)
print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Retrieve using filters
const filters = {
    "AND": [
        {"created_at": {"gte": "2024-07-10", "lte": "2024-07-20"}},
        {"user_id": "alex"}
    ]
}

const response = await client.getMemoryExport({
    filters: filters
});

console.log(response);
```

```json Output
{
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "current_role": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "years_experience": 8,
    "employment_status": "full_time",
    "education_level": "masters",
    "skills": ["Python", "AWS", "Machine Learning"]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Filters

You can apply various filters to customize which memories are included in the export:

- `user_id`: Filter memories by specific user
- `agent_id`: Filter memories by specific agent
- `run_id`: Filter memories by specific run
- `session_id`: Filter memories by specific session
- `created_at`: Filter memories by date

<Note>
The export process may take some time to complete, especially when dealing with a large number of memories or complex schemas.
