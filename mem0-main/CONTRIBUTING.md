### ðŸ“¦ Development Environment

We use `hatch` for managing development environments. To set up:

```bash
# Activate environment for specific Python version:
hatch shell dev_py_3_9   # Python 3.9
hatch shell dev_py_3_10  # Python 3.10  
hatch shell dev_py_3_11  # Python 3.11
hatch shell dev_py_3_12  # Python 3.12

# The environment will automatically install all dev dependencies
# Run tests within the activated shell:
make test
```

### ðŸ“Œ Pre-commit

To ensure our standards, make sure to install pre-commit before starting to contribute.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### ðŸ§ª Testing

We use `pytest` to test our code across multiple Python versions. You can run tests using:

```bash
# Run tests with default Python version
make test

# Test specific Python versions:
make test-py-3.9   # Python 3.9 environment
make test-py-3.10  # Python 3.10 environment
make test-py-3.11  # Python 3.11 environment
make test-py-3.12  # Python 3.12 environment

# When using hatch shells, run tests with:
make test  # After activating a shell with hatch shell test_XX
```

Make sure that all tests pass across all supported Python versions before submitting a pull request.

We look forward to your pull requests and can't wait to see your contributions!
