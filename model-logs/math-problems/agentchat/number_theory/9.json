  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Number Theory",
  "solution": "If $a$ is not relatively prime with $24$, then the modular inverse of $a$ does not exist. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a$ yields that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$, or equivalently that $a^2 - 1 \\equiv (a+1)(a-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. Since $a$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that at least one of $a+1$ or $a-1$ must be divisible by $3$. Also, since $a$ is not divisible by $2$, then both $a+1$ and $a-1$ are even, and exactly one of them is divisible by $4$. Thus, $3 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 24$ will always divide into $(a+1)(a-1)$, and so the statement is true for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $24$. The answer is the set of numbers relatively prime to $24$, namely $\\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\}$. There are $\\boxed{8}$ such numbers.\n\nThe number of positive integers smaller than and relatively prime to $24$ is also given by the Euler's totient function.",
